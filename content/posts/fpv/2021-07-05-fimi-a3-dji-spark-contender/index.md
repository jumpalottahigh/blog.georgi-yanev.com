I'm not one with a lot of experience in camera platform drones, since most of my time in the hobby has been spent in thinkering with FPV quadcopters.
But I recently had the chance to take a look at the [FIMI A3][1] drone and decided to check it out.

Let's take a look at what you get in the box.

Of course you get the drone itself.

A battery charger, a battery for the drone, USB cables for connecting the controller to a computer and propellers.

Additionally we also get the controller for the drone.

### <span id="setup" class="offset-top-nav">‚öôÔ∏è Setting up the FIMI A3</span>

I'm no expert when it comes down to camera platform drones but from my time with the FIMI A3, it seems the setup is pretty straight forward.

You should charge up the battery and the controller and then install the propellers.

You can also install a couple of SD cards in the drone and the controller in order to record both the
HD footage and the FPV feed if you so desire.

Next we need to install the battery and we're pretty much ready to hit the field.
