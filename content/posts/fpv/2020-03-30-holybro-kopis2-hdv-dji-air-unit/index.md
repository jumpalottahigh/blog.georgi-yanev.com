I've finally decided to make the plunge into digital FPV drones with the [DJI Digital FPV system][2]. I've been very interested for a while now and lucky to finally be able to get into it. For my first digital FPV experience I've chosen to go with an already assembled quad, instead of buiding my own from scratch.

The main reason for that is because I'd really like to focus on the experience itself and evaluate that for what it is, rather than evaluate a new custom build.

When doing so, going with a drone as tried and tested as the [Holybro Kopis 2 HDV][1] that excels in performance is a very safe bet.

I don't want to discourage you from building one from scratch, however, in fact, I always encourage you to try and build your own, but especially if it's your first one, I **highly** recommend grabbing a prebuilt drone that you can learn to fly on and enjoy, as well as learn to repair when you crash it.

If you decide to follow along and grab the same quad as I did, do note that the Holybro Kopis 2 HDV can be purchased with and without the DJI air unit. Because I grabbed a DJI bundle with the goggles, controller and air unit already, I opted in to grab the Holybro Kopis without the air unit.

If you are in the same boat as me, I'll include instructions on how to completely setup your quad if you need to add the DJI air unit on your own.

### üì¶ <span id="unboxing">Unboxing</span>

Coming in at about \$250 without the air unit, the [Holybro Kopis 2 HDV][1] is not one of the cheapest quads out there but it does offer an unboxing experience to match the price.

Once you get past the Holybro box, you discover what looks and feels like a very high quality carry case.

![Holybro Kopis 2 HDV high quality carry case](holybro-kopis2-hdv-dji-air-unit-2.jpg)

Inside the case the Kopis 2 is sitting nice and snug, in the middle of the case, strapped in securely with a velcro strap.

![Holybro Kopis 2 HDV in its carry case](holybro-kopis2-hdv-dji-air-unit-3.jpg)

The upper part of the carry case has a zippable container that hosts the following items:

2 sets of props, a small bag with prop nuts, a few spare screws, zip ties, double sided sticky tape, a parts list sheet, and a DJI air unit connection cable for the flight controller.

The props are TODO:

The carry case strap is a nice inclusion, and if you were wondering the same, the quad does fit inside the case with the props on, so this is not useless at all.

TODO: add picture of quad with props in the carry case

The quad looks legit like a piece of art and feels very high quality, so let's take a closer look at the components it comes with.

### ‚öô <span id="setup" class="offset-top-nav">Setup</span>

TODO:

As with most other quads, to get started we need to **bind a radio controller to the drone's receiver** and take a **look at the Betaflight configuration**.

#### üîó Bind the receiver to a radio

TODO:

#### üëÄ Check the Betaflight configuration

TODO:

1.  **Configuration tab**

    > Props in or Props out mode - important to know how to put on your props. `MOTOR_STOP` off. `Accelerometer` on for angle (stability) mode. `SPI RX support` and `FRSKY_D` for D8 mode.

    > ![Betaflight Configuration tab part 1](mobula6-tinywhoop-full-review-25.jpg)

    > `Airmode` is on. `RX_LOST` and `RX_SET` are on in case you want to use the motors to beep for a lost model alarm since we don't have an onboard buzzer.

    > ![Betaflight Configuration tab part 2](mobula6-tinywhoop-full-review-26.jpg)

    > ‚úÖ All good here, the defaults match what I expected so no changes needed.

2.  **Receiver tab**

    > Here I'm making sure the `Channel Map` is **TAER1234**. That's what my radio is set to and a match here makes sure the quad won't flip out when I start flying. ‚úÖ All good.

    > ![Betaflight Receiver tab](mobula6-tinywhoop-full-review-27.jpg)

3.  **Modes tab**

    > Arming is set to `AUX1` which is whichever switch you set to `Channel5` earlier in the Mixer screen on your radio. That's fine. Then I notice AUX2 (Channel6 switch) is set by default to start-up in angle mode, and any other position will set the quad to acro. That's fine too. And I have turtle mode (Flip over after crash) on the third switch. ‚úÖ Perfect, no changes needed.

    > ![Betaflight Modes tab](mobula6-tinywhoop-full-review-28.jpg)

4.  **OSD tab**

    > In the OSD tab I care to see if `RSSI value` is displayed, I also like to see current draw, throttle value and flight time elapsed. ‚úÖ All good, no changes needed.

    > ![Betaflight OSD tab](mobula6-tinywhoop-full-review-29.jpg)

Let's go fly!
