TODO:

As with most other quads, to get started we need to **bind a radio controller to the drone's receiver** and take a **look at the Betaflight configuration**.

#### 🔗 Bind the receiver to a radio

TODO:

#### 👀 Check the Betaflight configuration

TODO:

1.  **Configuration tab**

    > Props in or Props out mode - important to know how to put on your props. `MOTOR_STOP` off. `Accelerometer` on for angle (stability) mode. `SPI RX support` and `FRSKY_D` for D8 mode.

    > ![Betaflight Configuration tab part 1](mobula6-tinywhoop-full-review-25.jpg)

    > `Airmode` is on. `RX_LOST` and `RX_SET` are on in case you want to use the motors to beep for a lost model alarm since we don't have an onboard buzzer.

    > ![Betaflight Configuration tab part 2](mobula6-tinywhoop-full-review-26.jpg)

    > ✅ All good here, the defaults match what I expected so no changes needed.

2.  **Receiver tab**

    > Here I'm making sure the `Channel Map` is **TAER1234**. That's what my radio is set to and a match here makes sure the quad won't flip out when I start flying. ✅ All good.

    > ![Betaflight Receiver tab](mobula6-tinywhoop-full-review-27.jpg)

3.  **Modes tab**

    > Arming is set to `AUX1` which is whichever switch you set to `Channel5` earlier in the Mixer screen on your radio. That's fine. Then I notice AUX2 (Channel6 switch) is set by default to start-up in angle mode, and any other position will set the quad to acro. That's fine too. And I have turtle mode (Flip over after crash) on the third switch. ✅ Perfect, no changes needed.

    > ![Betaflight Modes tab](mobula6-tinywhoop-full-review-28.jpg)

4.  **OSD tab**

    > In the OSD tab I care to see if `RSSI value` is displayed, I also like to see current draw, throttle value and flight time elapsed. ✅ All good, no changes needed.

Let's go fly!
