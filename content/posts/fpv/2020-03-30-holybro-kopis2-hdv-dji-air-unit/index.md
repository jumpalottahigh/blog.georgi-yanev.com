I've finally decided to make the plunge into digital FPV drones with the [DJI Digital FPV system][2]. I've been very interested for a while now and lucky to finally be able to get into it. For my first digital FPV experience I've chosen to go with an already assembled quad, instead of buiding my own from scratch.

The main reason for that is because I'd really like to focus on the experience itself and evaluate that for what it is, rather than evaluate a new custom build.

When doing so, going with a drone as tried and tested as the [Holybro Kopis 2 HDV][1] that excels in performance is a very safe bet.

I don't want to discourage you from building one from scratch, however, in fact, I always encourage you to try and build your own, but especially if it's your first one, I **highly** recommend grabbing a prebuilt drone that you can learn to fly on and enjoy, as well as learn to repair when you crash it.

TODO:

As with most other quads, to get started we need to **bind a radio controller to the drone's receiver** and take a **look at the Betaflight configuration**.

#### 🔗 Bind the receiver to a radio

TODO:

#### 👀 Check the Betaflight configuration

TODO:

1.  **Configuration tab**

    > Props in or Props out mode - important to know how to put on your props. `MOTOR_STOP` off. `Accelerometer` on for angle (stability) mode. `SPI RX support` and `FRSKY_D` for D8 mode.

    > ![Betaflight Configuration tab part 1](mobula6-tinywhoop-full-review-25.jpg)

    > `Airmode` is on. `RX_LOST` and `RX_SET` are on in case you want to use the motors to beep for a lost model alarm since we don't have an onboard buzzer.

    > ![Betaflight Configuration tab part 2](mobula6-tinywhoop-full-review-26.jpg)

    > ✅ All good here, the defaults match what I expected so no changes needed.

2.  **Receiver tab**

    > Here I'm making sure the `Channel Map` is **TAER1234**. That's what my radio is set to and a match here makes sure the quad won't flip out when I start flying. ✅ All good.

    > ![Betaflight Receiver tab](mobula6-tinywhoop-full-review-27.jpg)

3.  **Modes tab**

    > Arming is set to `AUX1` which is whichever switch you set to `Channel5` earlier in the Mixer screen on your radio. That's fine. Then I notice AUX2 (Channel6 switch) is set by default to start-up in angle mode, and any other position will set the quad to acro. That's fine too. And I have turtle mode (Flip over after crash) on the third switch. ✅ Perfect, no changes needed.

    > ![Betaflight Modes tab](mobula6-tinywhoop-full-review-28.jpg)

4.  **OSD tab**

    > In the OSD tab I care to see if `RSSI value` is displayed, I also like to see current draw, throttle value and flight time elapsed. ✅ All good, no changes needed.

Let's go fly!
