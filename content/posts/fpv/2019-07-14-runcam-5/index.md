It's finally here! RunCam's latest GoPro competitor camera - the [RunCam 5][1]. In the meantime, GoPro has discountinued the Session 5 - many FPV pilots' favorite camera, leaving people with the option to grab a refurbished one from Ebay, buy used from elsewhere or move on to use a Hero 6 with a slightly different form factor. This is where RunCam's new offering comes in.

There are a number of comparison videos on the Internet so definitely do some more research before you purchase anything, but for many reasons I'm very much interested in the RunCam 5 camera. My excitement stems mainly from the fact that RunCam makes cameras especially dedicated for FPV pilots. Furthermore **I have been using RunCam's Split cameras for over a year now and I am very pleased with the fpv feed when flying, as well as the 1080p HD video recording**.

Is the [RunCam 5][1] a worthy competitor and costing only a \$100 (a fraction of the price of a GoPro camera) is it an option to consider switching to?

Let's find out!

### üì¶ <span id="unboxing">Unboxing</span>

RunCam's products almost always offer a premium unboxing experience with almost Apple-like quality. This one comes in a solid hard cardboard box with a slide-on top.

![RunCam 5 Box](runcam-5-1.jpg)

Underneath the box you can find a field to scratch off and expose a code for verifying your product.

![RunCam 5 Box Below](runcam-5-2.jpg)

Inside we find the camera sitting in the middle of a bed of a sponge like soft material, wrapped from all sides.

![RunCam 5 inside its shipping box](runcam-5-3.jpg)

The lense has a protective plastic layer that needs to be peeled off before usage. We also notice a single button on top and an LED.

![RunCam 5 front shot](runcam-5-4.jpg)

On the left hand side there is a micro USB port for charging or connecting to a computer for accessing the SD card contents without taking out the SD card.

![RunCam 5 front left shot](runcam-5-5.jpg)

On the right hand side there is a **sliding panel, that when slid open exposes the SD card slot where you can put your memory card**. Slide it shut and your SD card is decently protected from getting lost while you're flying. Above the SD card slot there is a reset button, should you ever need to use it.

And here's a shot from the back of the camera.

In addition, you get a manual and a small box with a few accesories.

![RunCam 5, manual and a box with accessories](runcam-5-8.jpg)

Inside that box we find a USB to micro USB cable for charging and video downloads and two high-quality rubberized velcro straps.

![RunCam 5 and all accessories unpacked](runcam-5-9.jpg)

The straps are indeed of decent quality and the rubberized coating definitely helps a ton with gripping tightly around the camera.

### üì¶ <span id="specs" class="offset-top-nav">Specifications</span>

One of the most outstanding features of the [RunCam 5][1] is its weight! **It's by far one of the (if not THE) lightest camera in its class!** It comes in at just **56 grams**. That's very, very light. In comparison the Hero 5 Session weighs 74 grams. Here are the rest of the technical specifications:

![RunCam 5 technical specifications](runcam-5-14.png)

In terms of **dimensions**, they are quite similar to the GoPro Hero Session 5 and that means that the RunCam 5 would fit in all existing TPU mounts. I use [this mount][5] and had no issues, the fit is nice and snug and you can also use one of the provided rubberized velcro straps to hold the camera in place extra tight.

As far as battery capacity goes, **RunCam claim the built-in 960 mAh battery should get you more than 90 minutes of 1080p 60fps recording time, or about 60 minutes of 4k 30fps recording time**. And yes, the battery is irreplaceable, built-in battery. Which might be one of the necessary shortcuts RunCam had to take in order to drive the price of the camera that low. I personally don't mind at all that the battery is built-in.

To charge, use the micro USB port and DC current in the range of 5V - 15V.

Onto the video specs:

![RunCam 5 video specs](runcam-5-15.png)

The RunCam 5 has a 12MP Sony sensor with a field of view of 145 degrees. The output is in MP4 format, it supports resolutions from 1080p to 4K which we will dive in deeper in a minute.

Depending on what resolution and framerate video you shoot you will need a U1 or U3 SD card. The supported capacity is up to 128 GB.

The RunCam 5 does not support WiFi connections, so let's look into what does that mean for setting the camera up.

### ‚öô <span id="setup" class="offset-top-nav">Setup</span>

For the complete setup instructions you can always refer to the [RunCam 5 user manual][2]. There are a few things to do to get up and running: **‚ö° Charge the camera up**, **üìá Insert a formatted SD card**, **üì± Choose your video settings** and **üèá Mount it on a drone**.

#### ‚ö° Charge it up

You can charge the RunCam 5 via its micro USB port. Plug it into a computer or something and let it be until the LED goes off. That indicates that the battery is full.

#### üìá Insert an SD card

Insert a high-quality, formatted SD card with decent capacity. We will be writing a lot of data and you need a fast card to do so. Don't underestimate the formatting step, as it can save you from headaches and lost footage issues. If you are unable to format your SD card via a computer, you can do that through the RunCam itself. Get a decent capacity card, I recommend at least 32 GB, but you know yourself better, take what makes sense. **Just note that 4-5 battery packs yield about 6-7 GB of footage easily**.

#### üì± Configure the settings

- via file

#### üèá Mount the RunCam 5 on a quad

Finally, let's mount the camera onto a quad. There are probably many ways to do so, plenty of projects on https://thingiverse.com that you could print, or just [purchase a mount like this one][5] from an online store.

![RunCam 5 mounted via a GoPro mount onto a Hawk 5 quadcopter](runcam-5-12.jpg)

This mount worked pretty good. Attached it with a couple of thicker zip ties and in addition ran around the rubberized velcro strap too.

Let's go fly!

### üÜö <span id="comparison" class="offset-top-nav">RunCam Split 2 comparison</span>

Now this part is a bit far fetched for a number of reasons and is not necessarily very scientific, but I found it interesting nevertheless and wanted to share the findings. We are going to compare the footage from the [RunCam 5][1] with footage from the [RunCam Split 2][3] (this link is for the slightly newer RunCam Split 2S version).

Why is this interesting? I've mentioned a number of times that I personally am a fan of split cameras. In fact, [my raw, unedited, single pack flight footage YouTube channel][4] is full of RunCam Split 2 and RunCam Split Mini videos. There's a lot of convenience in this setup and it works nicely if you need decent, although not the best of the best footage quality.

Here are the caveats:

- I'm using the RunCam Split 2 (the original oldest version), since then a RunCam Split 2S has come out, and it seems like a RunCam Split 3 might be well underway. TODO: check more info

Both comparison videos are using stock camera settings. The RunCam 5 costs $100, the Split 2S costs $80.E

The same port can be used to transfer files, if you have plugged it into a computer. To be able to access the SD card contents through the RunCam 5

Who is this for?

- GoPro deal in US BestBuy via their warranty policy
- Decent camera for just 100 bucks
- Non hardcore usage? Just good enough
- Very light, so if weight is an issue, could be worth picking this up

Video comparisons:

**with distortion correction**
1440p 60 fps superview with GO tool

**without distortion correction**
NO DISTORTION CORRECTION
in order of settings:
0000 - 1080p 60fps
0001 - 1080 60 XV
0003 - 1080 120fps
0004 - 1440p 60fps (\* best so far) even better stretched!
0005 - 2,7k 50fps
0006 - 4k 30fps (\* 3rd best so far)
0007 - 4k 30fps XV (\* 2nd best so far)
