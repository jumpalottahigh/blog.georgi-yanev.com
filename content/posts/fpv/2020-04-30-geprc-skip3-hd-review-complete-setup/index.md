I've been looking forward to this review for a while. My current main search and passion is to find a **performing, HD cinewhoop that flies like a toothpick**. And the short of it is, that I think I found it, and that's why I'm going to be reviewing, setting up and flying the [GEPRC Skip3 HD][1].

As a simple micro cinewhoop, I've loved flying the [Mobula7 HD][2] for over a year now, and to be fair I can still recommend it today, for some use cases. What I wish it did slightly better would be to have just a tad more performance at mid throttle.

On the other hand, getting into toothpicks last year with the [GEPRC Phantom][3] and the [Emax Tinyhawk Freestyle][4] was a very fun experience. There little quads fly and handle superbly and are to date my favorite toothpicks. They are such a joy to fly, but lack the capability to record full HD video.

So the obvious question was **"can we have that performance but also enjoy a 1080p HD video recording from a split camera"**. And this is the use case the Skip3 HD is trying to cover: give you full HD recording while flying like a racer.

### <span id="unboxing" class="offset-top-nav">üì¶ Unboxing</span>

Having unboxed a few other GEPRC products so far, the unboxing experience is pretty consistent and minimalistic. You get a GEPRC branded box with the items inside.

While on one hand it's nice to get a higher quality carry case (like you do with some drones), if the goal in GEPRC's case is to reduce the price by simply providing a box, then I'm on board. I can also confirm that although I always expected myself to toss the box aside after the initial setup, I always ended up actually keeping it and using it to transport the quad and its spare parts by tossing the box in my backpack.

![GEPRC Skip3 HD box](geprc-skip3-hd-review-complete-setup-2.jpg)

The contents of the box are wrapped in protective foam from all sides and the quad come wrapped in plastic film too.

![GEPRC Skip3 HD inside the box](geprc-skip3-hd-review-complete-setup-3.jpg)

Here is everything you get inside: the [GEPRC Skip3 HD][1] itself, a vtx channel table, FrSky XM+ receiver instructions, GEPRC stickers, 8 bi-blade propellers and a pack of extra items.

![GEPRC Skip3 HD all items included](geprc-skip3-hd-review-complete-setup-4.jpg)

In the additional items pack you can find: camera configuration joystick, screwdriver, hex tool, landing leg sticky foam padding, an extra battery velcro strap, spare screws, antenna tubes and tube end tips.

Here are the props unpacked:

And of course the drone itself:

### <span id="specs" class="offset-top-nav">üìù Specifications</span>

The [GEPRC Skip3 HD][1] is 120mm motor post to motor post.

![GEPRC Skip3 HD motor post to motor post distance](geprc-skip3-hd-review-complete-setup-8.jpg)

The dry weight is just **69 grams**.

![GEPRC Skip3 HD weighs 69 grams](geprc-skip3-hd-review-complete-setup-9.jpg)

The weight with four of the stock props is **72.3 grams**.

![GEPRC Skip3 HD with 4 props weighs 72.3 grams](geprc-skip3-hd-review-complete-setup-11.jpg)

And finally the all up weight with a [GNB 4S 520mAh battery][5] is **127.3 grams**.

![GEPRC Skip3 HD all up weight with a 4S GNB 520mAh battery is 127.3 grams](geprc-skip3-hd-review-complete-setup-12.jpg)

I also had a Turnigy Graphene 4S 500mAh battery lying around, which came in much heavier at **149.7 grams** all up weight. I'm a much bigger fan of GNB batteries, so besides for a few test flights, I probably won't be flying the Turnigy battery.

![GEPRC Skip3 HD all up weight with a 4S Turnigy 500mAh battery goes up to 149.7 grams](geprc-skip3-hd-review-complete-setup-13.jpg)

The quad looks gorgeous overall, but let's talk specs.

![GEPRC Skip3 HD](geprc-skip3-hd-review-complete-setup-16.jpg)

The Skip3 HD comes with the same motors you might have seen earlier on the [GEPRC CinePro 4K][6] - **GR1105 5000KV**. At this KV this a quad intended to run on 4S batteries, although you could go as low as 2S. Whatever the case, however, the product page **warns about not running tri-blade props**, since those would draw more current and you could burn a motor. I'll probably test that for you, so you don't have to take the chance, but more on that in the flying section below.

The props that the [GEPRC Skip3 HD][1] comes with are 75mm bi-blade propellers that weigh just under a gram (0.9g).

![GEPRC Skip3 HD 75mm bi-blade props measured](geprc-skip3-hd-review-complete-setup-6.jpg)

![GEPRC Skip3 HD's stock props weigh 0.9grams](geprc-skip3-hd-review-complete-setup-7.jpg)

The motor wires are braided which is a nice touch if you're into that sort of thing. More importantly they are held securely to the frame arms with a sturdy "cloth-based" sticky tape. The motors are plugged into the all-in-one (AIO) board with a connector (not directly soldered). Some people say there's some extra performance to be had with the direct solder approach, I think that's nearly negligible in this case and definitely minmaxing, but if you really want to squeeze every little bit of performance, you could consider direct soldering. For me that's an overkill at this point.

![GEPRC Skip3 HD motor close up](geprc-skip3-hd-review-complete-setup-17.jpg)

**The camera is the Caddx Baby Turtle V2**. This is a "split" type camera that is used for the real time FPV feed, as well as to record on board 1080p 60fps footage. I dare add that it's one of the best split time cameras nowadays (2019 / 2020).

It can also record at 1080p 30fps and 720p 60fps, if you feel like downgrading the quality, but chances are you probably don't need to do that.

This camera can record audio, which was ever so slightly less horrifying but even so, pretty much unusable. The motor noise is loud and high-pitched which probably won't allow for any other sound to be picked up from the environment. Unfortunately that's pretty much the case with all of these cameras and we yet have to see a split type camera with useful audio recording.

The output file format of the Caddx Baby Turtle V2 is MP4 and it supports class 10 SD cards with storage ranging from 8GB to 64GB. On average for a **6 minute flight the 1080p 60fps recording is about 1.36GB**.

The canopy is a pretty nice, high quality TPU print that let's you **adjust the camera angle from about 28 degress to about 45 degrees**.

![GEPRC Skip3 HD canopy](geprc-skip3-hd-review-complete-setup-18.jpg)

On the backside of the canopy there are slots for the VTX's dipole antenna, as well as for the receiver antennas. **The VTX is power-switchable between 25/100/200mW.**

![GEPRC Skip3 HD backside antenna opennings](geprc-skip3-hd-review-complete-setup-19.jpg)

A capacitor is soldered to and shrink-wrapped together with the xt30 connector. This is pretty much a standard nowadays, so nothing special about it.

![GEPRC Skip3 HD capacity on the xt30](geprc-skip3-hd-review-complete-setup-20.jpg)

A battery strap comes pre-installed under the quad, where we also have a rubber battery pad to provide additional grip and keep your battery in place when flying around or in crashes.

![GEPRC Skip3 HD battery strap and pad](geprc-skip3-hd-review-complete-setup-21.jpg)

This is how the flight stack is setup on the inside.

![GEPRC Skip3 HD stack](geprc-skip3-hd-review-complete-setup-22.jpg)

At the bottom we have a GEP-12A-F4 AIO board. As the name states it should support continuous current up to 12A on a 2S to 4S battery. The firmware target for the flight controller is **MATEKF411**.

Above the flight controller board is the Caddx Baby Turtle V2 board (this is also where you would plug in your SD card). On top of that is the VTX and on top of the VTX is the receiver (in my case, the FrSky XM+).

And all of that comes currently at about ~ \$170, which in my opinion is a pretty good deal for an HD toothpick drone.

    > ‚úÖ All good here, the defaults match what I expected so no changes needed.

2.  **Receiver tab**

    > Here I'm making sure the `Channel Map` is **TAER1234**. That's what my radio is set to and a match here makes sure the quad won't flip out when I start flying. ‚úÖ All good.

3.  **Modes tab**

    > Arming is set to `AUX1` which is whichever switch you set to `Channel5` earlier in the Mixer screen on your radio. That's fine. Then I notice AUX2 (Channel6 switch) is set by default to start-up in angle mode, and any other position will set the quad to acro. That's fine too. And I have turtle mode (Flip over after crash) on the third switch. ‚úÖ Perfect, no changes needed.

4.  **OSD tab**

### <span id="conclusion" class="offset-top-nav">üìë Conclusion</span>

I love toothpicks, but I seem to really prefer how good tri-blade props fly and everything they bring to the table in terms of handling. On any one of my tests so far I have never missed the extra performance I lost when switching to tri-blade vs bi-blade props. And I have ALWAYS appreciated the handling improvement. Maybe it's something you could get used to, but for now and for my flying style, I strongly prefer how quads fly on tri-blade props. **However, this is just my very subjective opinion and preference**. It's not to say that you wouldn't like bi-blade props for example. I strongly encourage everyone to try out for themselves and make up their own opinion.

TODO:
the video bit rate for 1080p 60fps (default) is ~ 30-31 Mbit

test camera how quick it reacts to light chagnes
write about configuring the camera with the joystick

prop wash or jello in the 1080p dvr (on the big open field)

The recording starts as soon as you plugin a battery and is stopped and written to the SD card if you unplugged.

Happy flying!
