Micro drones are quickly becoming one of my favorite class of drones in 2019 and the [Emax Tinyhawk Freestyle][1] is one of the reasons why. Flying this thing makes me really wonder how is it possible something that small to fly that much like a 5" quad and to be so fast and enjoyable.

I was fortunate enough to be able to compare the [Emax Tinyhawk Freestyle][1] to the [GEPRC Phantom][2], which is also one of the best toothpick class drones that came out in the middle of 2019. And it's funny that although both of those quadcopters are really, really amazing they are also quite different in terms of what they offer.

So stay tuned if you are in the market for one of those. Let's take a deeper look and compare them. I think this is going to be the right article for you.

### üì¶ <span id="unboxing">Unboxing</span>

Emax Tinyhawk Freestyle comes in a nice hard shell case, great for packing in the quad and carrying it around.

![Emax Tinyhawk Freestyle hard shell case](emax-tinyhawk-freestyle-toothpick-review-and-setup-1.jpg)

This is everything you get inside the case.

![Emax Tinyhawk Freestyle in its box with all its accessories](emax-tinyhawk-freestyle-toothpick-review-and-setup-2.jpg)

You get 2 450mah 1S batteries with a PH2.0 connector, an USB charger board for up to 6 such batteries, some spare screws and stand offs, a manual and of course stickers.

![Emax Tinyhawk Freestyle spare props, batteries, charger, screws, manual, stickers](emax-tinyhawk-freestyle-toothpick-review-and-setup-3.jpg)

Among the spare parts we find an XT30 connector, in case you want to change the PH2.0 connector the quad comes with. We also have this PH2.0 "jumper" that is used to terminate one of the battery connectors so you could fly the quad on 1S.

![XT30 connector and a PH2.0 jumper](emax-tinyhawk-freestyle-toothpick-review-and-setup-4.jpg)

You get 2 full sets (8 props) of the [Avon Rush 2.5"][3] props.

![8 spare Avon Rush 2.5" props](emax-tinyhawk-freestyle-toothpick-review-and-setup-5.jpg)

And of course the quad itself.

### üìù <span id="specs" class="offset-top-nav">Specifications</span>

The all in one board and the camera used in the Tinyhawk Freestyle are the tried and tested ones from the Emax Tinyhawk S (F4 (MATEKF411RX Firmware), with a 5A rated 4 in 1 ESC). The frame is a **carbon fiber unibody frame with top mounted battery**. The micro USB port on the all in one board is conveniently exposed and easy to access for Betaflight configuration.

![Emax Tinyhawk Freestyle bottom plate](emax-tinyhawk-freestyle-toothpick-review-and-setup-12.jpg)

![Emax Tinyhawk Freestyle front right](emax-tinyhawk-freestyle-toothpick-review-and-setup-11.jpg)

A capacitor is installed to the battery terminals on the board. The built-in SPI based receiver's antenna is guided out the back and is not likely to get chopped off by the props.

![Emax Tinyhawk Freestyle capacitor and micro USB port](emax-tinyhawk-freestyle-toothpick-review-and-setup-10.jpg)

Speaking of batteries, this drone allows for top mounting of the batteries. The battery connector is Emax's interesting solution to allow plugging in 2 PH2.0 connectors (or just one if you use the jumper for the other slot).

![Emax Tinyhawk Freestyle PH2.0 battery connector](emax-tinyhawk-freestyle-toothpick-review-and-setup-9.jpg)

The motors are the Emax branded TH1103 7000KV, spinning up Avon Rush 2.5" props.

![Emax Tinyhawk Freestyle Avon Rush 2.5" prop](emax-tinyhawk-freestyle-toothpick-review-and-setup-6.jpg)

CMOS camera, with no possibility to _easily_ adjust the angle (although I haven't needed to do so in my tests). 25mW VTX and a VTX antenna coming up and away from the side, out of the props' reach.

![Emax Tinyhawk Freestyle vtx antenna](emax-tinyhawk-freestyle-toothpick-review-and-setup-13.jpg)

The quad comes in at **46.1** grams dry weight...

![Emax Tinyhawk Freestyle comes in at 46.1 grams on the scale](emax-tinyhawk-freestyle-toothpick-review-and-setup-18.jpg)

and with a couple of the 450mah batteries you get in the package...

![Emax Tinyhawk Freestyle 2 450mah batteries](emax-tinyhawk-freestyle-toothpick-review-and-setup-16.jpg)

the all up weight is **71.4** grams.

Be careful with the provided charging board, not a biggie, but the battery slot plastic fell off when I disconnected a battery from it for the first time. You can just put it back in.

![Emax Tinyhawk Freestyle charger board with battery slot off](emax-tinyhawk-freestyle-toothpick-review-and-setup-20.jpg)

Or use one of these boards, which are a bit better (but not miles better really). And at least allow charging on the go via an XT60 source plug.

![board for charging up to 6 ph2.0 batteries](emax-tinyhawk-freestyle-toothpick-review-and-setup-21.jpg)

The overall build quality is pretty high with a lot of minor details handled very professionally and neatly. As always, reluctantly I've smacked it around quite a bit while flying over concrete, and there has been no issues with any component so far.

NOTES:

Binding Procedure
Binding is the process of uniquely associating a receiver to a transmitter module. A
transmitter module can be bound to multiple receivers (not to be used
simultaneously). A receiver can only be bound to one transmitter module.
1.Hold the bind button for 2 seconds while the flight controller is already on. When
the Blue LED is on, it means the receiver is in BIND MODE
2.Turn on the transmitter, make sure it is set to D8 mode, and then set it into bind
mode. When the BLUE LED on the flight controller starts flashing, it means bind
successful.
3.Power cycle the flight controller and take your radio out of bind mode.

NOTES ‚òù

### üöÅ <span id="flying" class="offset-top-nav">Flying</span>

The [Emax Tinyhawk Freestyle][1] flies absolutely spectacular. It's one of the quads that flies so well that I had absolutely no desire to do with it anything further in terms of tuning. I just want to fly it all the time. Here's the TL;DR recap if you don't feel like reading my detailed impressions of the quad.

_What does it do well?_
**Flight chracteristic, handling, flight times, battery reusability, easy to setup and to fly.**

_What could be better?_
**Range.**

#### Maiden flight, stock 2 x 1S 450mah batteries.

<div style="text-align: center">
  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uaqb8IDhddY?list=PLt8_2AobQjAdaL2fUZM8zd6xzNZdMt0nz&index=0&rel=0" frameBorder="0" allowFullScreen title="Emax Tinyhawk Freestyle maiden flight"></iframe>
</div>

Immediately during the maiden flight right after I took off **I noticed how much power this thing has and how locked in the tune really is**. Great job by Emax there. A big part of how the [Emax Tinyhawk Freestyle][1] handles is thanks to the amazing [Avon Rush 2.5 inch tri-blade props][3]. Those give you really precise handling in turns. At the same time, they don't really seem to consume a ton of amps. The Tinyhawk Freestyle is so lightweight and zips around so fast that you really won't be able to believe how fast it goes from the moment you take off as soon as you punch that throttle.

A thing to note is that the camera is a 4x3 camera and depending on what goggles you have, if you're using them in 16x9 mode, it might take a bit to adjust to the fish eye effect. The good news is that you do get used to it after a while.

**The [Emax Tinyhawk Freestyle][1] flew so well on these 1s 450mah batteries that come with it that I legit had no desire to even test other batteries**. It flew great, handled easily and the thrust to weight ratio on it was spot on, at least in my opinion.

You just completely lose yourself and enjoy flying around at what seems to you like really high speeds. You get flight times of 4-5 minutes easily even if you keep the throttle at more than 40% the whole flight. Crazy! I don't think I've ever had a quad that efficient, while still feeling powerful and zippy. In fact, it's interesting that you get almost the same flight times whether you fly it 1S or 2S. And the performance is also hard to differentiate. It feels almost a bit weird but that's how it is. I do fly it mostly on 2S though in anyway.

#### Here is the flight footage of the Emax Tinyhawk Freestyle on 1S stock 450mah battery.

The battery choice is perhaps one of the biggest upsides of this drone set. Because Emax have opted in to use 2 PH2.0 connectors, it allows you to reuse your batteries, in case you have any of those lying around.

![GNB 1S 450mah batteries](emax-tinyhawk-freestyle-toothpick-review-and-setup-14.jpg)

**For a lot of people, including me, that's gonna be a big deal**! Those are always easy to charge, they have great capacity to weight ratio for these little quads. And if you have none of those lying around, you could replace the PH2.0 connectors with the provided XT30 connector, in case you have more of this type of batteries.

For lolz and science I even flew it on these Eachine 300mah 1S lipos and **it still flew over 4 minutes with little to no voltage sags**.

![Eachine 1S 300mah batteries](emax-tinyhawk-freestyle-toothpick-review-and-setup-15.jpg)

Pretty decent! This is just to say that if you have some of those batteries lying around you can reuse them with the [Emax Tinyhawk Freestyle][1]. But if you are buying, I still recommend getting the [GNB 450mah 1S batteries][4].

<div style="text-align: center">
  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uaqb8IDhddY?list=PLt8_2AobQjAdaL2fUZM8zd6xzNZdMt0nz&index=2&rel=0" frameBorder="0" allowFullScreen title="Emax Tinyhawk Freestyle on 2 x 1S 300mah eachine battery"></iframe>
</div>

In terms of flight characteristics I'm a bit curious to try out some bi-blade props on the [Tinyhawk Freestyle][1], although I also got to admit that it is completely unnecessary, as the stock build, tune and props already provide an amazing and very enjoyable flight experience.

And here I have to also mention how easy is to go out flying with this toothpick. Put a bunch of battries to charge, leave the house in less than 30 minutes, fly anywhere as it's easier to find a spot for such little drone, without bugging people. Very, very easy.

And this is how I enjoy flying this drone nowadays - just throttle up and never let go, pretending I'm a racer üòÖ. I honestly completely forget this is a micro drone when I'm flying it.

</div>

### üîù <span id="upgrades" class="offset-top-nav">Upgrades</span>

I don't have a lot to mention in terms of potential upgrades. Most of my ideas are for testing different props. But honestly it's not necessary.

One thing I might consider doing and could suggest you do as well, if it is easy to pull off (and I don't think it would be very hard), is to **add a full range receiver**. It should hopefully not ruin the flight characteristics with a few added grams, but will add a lot of enjoyment in terms of flexibility and how far you can fly. I have to admit I gotta be pretty mindful with this one flying around and not going too far away. Not a bit issues, but good to be aware of it.

I would not add an HD split type camera to this one, as this will surely ruin the flight characteristics, as the [Emax Tinyhawk Freestyle][1] is indeed super lightweight and every little bit on top will be felt and will change things a lot.

### üìë <span id="conclusion" class="offset-top-nav">Conclusion</span>

2019 has been a great year for these micros. There are a lot of amazing and great value toothpick class drones out there. I feel like the best thing about them is that you can pick one that is directly tailored to your situation.

And if we compare the [GEPRC Phantom][5] with the [Emax Tinyhawk Freestyle][1] one of the things that immediately becomes obvious is that even though both of these quads fly awesome, they are also so different and would fit different scenarious, or different pilots.

From what you get in the box with the Emax Tinyhawk Freestyle it seems to be best suited to someone who has a lot of those 1S 450mah batteries with a PH2.0 connector. The quad flies amazing with those, you will get pretty lengthy flight times of like four to five minutes. This is a big deal because it would allow you to reuse your existing batteries.

The flight experience is super enjoyable and because the quad is quite easy to handle I would say that it's suitable for people newer to the hobby. Maybe like practiced beginners.

Some of the drawbacks worth mentioning here are the lack of a full range receiver. I think the board supports installing one, but don't quote me on that and definitely do some research first if this is important for you. I would also assume that the added weight should not be too much and would not ruin the awesome flight characteristics.

The camera is fairly decent and very very lightweight, so I understand why they've picked it up. I'm scepticle to believe you could make this one work with a split type camera, but I guess it's probably not impossible. Maybe a RunCam Split 3 Nano could work? We'll have to wait and see I might do that mod in the future.

But regardless if you're just getting into the hobby or you have been flying drones for a while now, the Emax Tinyhawk is synonymous with the word fun. It's got a locked in tune and is pure pleasure to rip around anywhere. Like, really, anywhere. It's relatively quiet and is not gonna bother anyone if you decide to fly it in a park or a more populated area.

Either way, have fun and happy flying!
