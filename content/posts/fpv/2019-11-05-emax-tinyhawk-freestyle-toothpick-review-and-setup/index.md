Micro drones are quickly becoming one of my favorite class of drones in 2019 and the [Emax Tinyhawk Freestyle][1] is one of the reasons why. Flying this thing makes me really wonder how is it possible something that small to fly that much like a 5" quad and to be so fast and enjoyable.

I was fortunate enough to be able to compare the [Emax Tinyhawk Freestyle][1] to the [GEPRC Phantom][2], which is also one of the best toothpick class drones that came out in the middle of 2019. And it's funny that although both of those quadcopters are really, really amazing they are also quite different in terms of what they offer.

So stay tuned if you are in the market for one of those. Let's take a deeper look and compare them. I think this is going to be the right article for you.

### üì¶ <span id="unboxing">Unboxing</span>

Emax Tinyhawk Freestyle comes in a nice hard shell case, great for packing in the quad and carrying it around.

This is everything you get inside the case.

![Emax Tinyhawk Freestyle in its box with all its accessories](emax-tinyhawk-freestyle-toothpick-review-and-setup-2.jpg)

You get 2 450mah 1S batteries with a PH2.0 connector, an USB charger board for up to 6 such batteries, some spare screws and stand offs, a manual and of course stickers.

Among the spare parts we find an XT30 connector, in case you want to change the PH2.0 connector the quad comes with. We also have this PH2.0 "jumper" that is used to terminate one of the battery connectors so you could fly the quad on 1S.

You get 2 full sets (8 props) of the [Avon Rush 2.5"][3] props.

And of course the quad itself.

NOTES:

Binding Procedure
Binding is the process of uniquely associating a receiver to a transmitter module. A
transmitter module can be bound to multiple receivers (not to be used
simultaneously). A receiver can only be bound to one transmitter module.
1.Hold the bind button for 2 seconds while the flight controller is already on. When
the Blue LED is on, it means the receiver is in BIND MODE
2.Turn on the transmitter, make sure it is set to D8 mode, and then set it into bind
mode. When the BLUE LED on the flight controller starts flashing, it means bind
successful.
3.Power cycle the flight controller and take your radio out of bind mode.

### üöÅ <span id="flying" class="offset-top-nav">Flying</span>

The [Emax Tinyhawk Freestyle][1] flies absolutely spectacular. It's one of the quads that flies so well that I had absolutely no desire to do with it anything further in terms of tuning. I just want to fly it all the time. Here's the TL;DR recap if you don't feel like reading my detailed impressions of the quad.

_What does it do well?_
**Flight chracteristic, handling, flight times, battery reusability, easy to setup and to fly.**

_What could be better?_
**Range.**

Maiden flight, stock 2 x 1S 450mah batteries.

</div>

Immediately during the maiden flight right after I took off **I noticed how much power this thing has and how locked in the tune really is**. Great job by Emax there. A big part of how the [Emax Tinyhawk Freestyle][1] handles is thanks to the amazing [Avon Rush 2.5 inch tri-blade props][3]. Those give you really precise handling in turns. At the same time, they don't really seem to consume a ton of amps. The Tinyhawk Freestyle is so lightweight and zips around so fast that you really won't be able to believe how fast it goes from the moment you take off as soon as you punch that throttle.

A thing to note is that the camera is a 4x3 camera and depending on what goggles you have, if you're using them in 16x9 mode, it might take a bit to adjust to the fish eye effect. The good news is that you do get used to it after a while.

**The [Emax Tinyhawk Freestyle][1] flew so well on these 1s 450mah batteries that come with it that I legit had no desire to even test other batteries**. It flew great, handled easily and the thrust to weight ratio on it was spot on, at least in my opinion.

You just completely lose yourself and enjoy flying around at what seems to you like really high speeds. You get flight times of 4-5 minutes easily even if you keep the throttle at more than 40% the whole flight. Crazy! I don't think I've ever had a quad that efficient, while still feeling powerful and zippy. In fact, it's interesting that you get almost the same flight times whether you fly it 1S or 2S. And the performance is also hard to differentiate. It feels almost a bit weird but that's how it is. I do fly it mostly on 2S though in anyway.

Here is the flight footage of the Emax Tinyhawk Freestyle on 1S stock 450mah battery.

The battery choice is perhaps one of the biggest upsides of this drone set. Because Emax have opted in to use 2 PH2.0 connectors, it allows you to reuse your batteries, in case you have any of those lying around.

TODO: image of batteries

For a lot of people, including me, that's gonna be a big deal! Those are always easy to charge, the have a great capacity to weight ratio for these little quads. And if you have none of those lying around, you could replace the PH2.0 connectors with the provided XT30 connector, in case you have more of this type of batteries.

In terms of flight characteristics I'm a bit curious to try out some bi-blade props on the [Tinyhawk Freestyle][1], although I also got to admit that it is completely unnecessary, as the stock build, tune and props already provide an amazing and very enjoyable flight experience.

And here I have to also mention how easy is to go out flying with this toothpick. Put a bunch of battries to charge, leave the house in less than 30 minutes, fly anywhere as it's easier to find a spot for such little drone, without bugging people. Very, very easy.

CONCLUSION üëá

### üìë <span id="conclusion" class="offset-top-nav">Conclusion</span>

In conclusion then the inactinic of freestyle, what for you.

2019 has been a great year for for a lot of these microns a lot of these toothpicks classrooms there are a lot of really viable and amazing options out there. I feel like the best thing about those ones is that you can pick one that is directly tailored to your situation.

And if I compare the gap RC Phantom with the Emax tiny hope free style one of the things that immediately becomes obvious is that even though both of these quads fly really really awesome. It also a little bit different. And of course there is always room to improve and upgrade them as well.

But from what you get in the box already the max tiny, hopefully style seems to be best suited to someone who has a lot of those 1s. 450 million power batteries with a pH 2 connector. The quad really flies amazing with those you will get really lengthy flight times of like four to five minutes.

And the flight experience is super enjoyable. So. This this really is a big deal when one may be of the biggest deal to me with this one because it does allow me to use all these batteries.

I I assume that the blood would not fly as nice on those batteries. But was really pleasant to surprise the it actually flies amazing.

Some of the downsides here are the lack of a full range receiver, so you don't get a full range receiver what I think the board supports installing one, so if you would like to upgrade to one. Could do so. That's not great expense and by adding just a little bit to extra weight.

One.

The camera is fairly decent and very very lightweight, so I understand why they've picked it up. But you could consider upgrading to some sort of an HD camp if recording is even the HD video is important to you however, what would be the impact on flight characteristics so that added up weight remains to be seen.

It's one of the tests I would like to do in the future.

But regardless if you're just getting into the floppy or you have in flying. Drones for a while now. The next 24 really is a. Is synonymous with the word fun. It's. Got a locked on tune and it's really amazing to just enjoy and fly around. And much like most of the micro plants, you could just go fly it in parks.

It's relatively quiet. It's not gonna bother anyone. You shouldn't feel like a minister society. You're flying one of those little guys.

Just really really enjoy yourself. Happy flying.
