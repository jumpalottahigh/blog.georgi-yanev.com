It's a truly great time for our FPV racing and freestyle hobby. For one, we get to enjoy a pretty rapid rate of tech improvement. Even though I've been into FPV drones for about a little under 3 years, it never seizes to amaze me how much things have changed.

**The [Mobula 6][1] micro drone is a living embodiment of these rapid changes**. It's a very well executed product, and at only 20g it's easily one of the smallest and lightest micro drones out there, that still flies and feels like a bigger drone and not like a toy.

I've been buying and trying Happymodel's products since the Snapper7 a few years back, and have never been disappointed with them. The [Mobula7 HD][5] was a particular favorite of mine from 2019, and I'm still planning to try out the [Larva X HD][6] a bit later this year too.

That's all just to say that while I do like Happymodel, I will be, as always, telling things as they are and not be fanboying around. This is not a paid advertisement, just my experience with the Mobula6. And it blew my mind a bit üòÖ. Let's go!

### üì¶ <span id="unboxing">Unboxing</span>

The unboxing experience is fine and pretty minimalistic, I think in a good way. The [Mobula6][1] arrives in a small cardboard box.

![Mobula6 box](mobula6-tinywhoop-full-review-1.jpg)

And here is everything you get inside. Besides a print copy of the user manual,

![The contents of the Mobula6 box](mobula6-tinywhoop-full-review-2.jpg)

you get a tiny philips head screwdriver, prop remover tool, USB battery charger,

and the Mobula6 itself.

### üìù <span id="specs" class="offset-top-nav">Specifications</span>

In terms of specs, the **biggest deal here is the weight of the drone**.

![Mobula6 on the scale comes in at 20g dry weight](mobula6-tinywhoop-full-review-20.jpg)

The [Mobula6][1] comes in at **barely just 20g** dry weight with props. Or 19g without props, as 4 props add up to a gram.

![4 gemfan props weigh 1 gram on the scale](mobula6-tinywhoop-full-review-21.jpg)

**The all-up-weight (AUW) with the provided stock battery is just 27.7g**.

![Mobula6 with stock battery comes in at 27.7g on the scale](mobula6-tinywhoop-full-review-22.jpg)

With a GNB 1S 450mah battery, the AUW is 33.3g

![Mobula6 with a 450mah 1S GNB battery comes in at 33.3g on the scale](mobula6-tinywhoop-full-review-23.jpg)

Speaking of batteries, the Mobula6's battery connector is the common and popular among tinywhoops **PH2.0**. Great for battery re-usability if you have plenty of those lying around already.

The canopy is plastic and allows for adjusting the camera angle via screws (I haven't had to do that though). It's somewhat sturdy, but I think it has a couple of weaker points towards the lower back. We'll have to see how it holds up.

![Mobula6 back](mobula6-tinywhoop-full-review-9.jpg)

Same goes for the frame. I don't expect miracles from it, but it's held up fine for now and I've smacked my Mobula6 around quite a bunch indoors and outdoors over the past couple of weeks. The only thing so far is the plastic getting a bit whiter on one spot from a crash, but still solid and in one piece. Either way, replacement frames if needed are easy to obtain for about \$4. [TODO: link to replacement frames - https://www.banggood.com/Happymodel-Bwhoop65-65mm-Brushless-Tiny-Whoop-Frame-Kit-For-Indoor-FPV-RC-Drone-p-1321622.html?rmmds=search&ID=229&cur_warehouse=CN]

[TODO: Only video: I would imagine you could probably even print a micro frame yourself? Let me know in the comments if anyone of you has ever had some luck with 3D printer frames for micro drones in particular.]

The battery bay houses the provided 300mah batteries perfectly as you would imagine. For bigger batteries you can remove the battery bay completely, or use a rubber band for a somewhat decent fit, while not damaging the capability to fit perfectly the stock batteries. I'll show you how I attached my 450mah batteries a bit later in the article.

![Mobula6 bottom](mobula6-tinywhoop-full-review-10.jpg)

The [Mobula6][1] comes with an option of 19000KV or 25000KV motors. Not super much difference, but I opted in for the 19000KV version. The motors are **Happymodel branded SE0802** with 1mm shaft diameter and spin up Gemfan 1219 props.

![Mobula6 19000 motor](mobula6-tinywhoop-full-review-11.jpg)

**Everything else on this quad except the camera is on the same PCB**. As always there will be people that like this and those that don't. I'm in the fan camp. Clearly the big drawback here is that burning out 1 ESC, messing up your VTX or receiver, or say breaking the micro USB port, and you gotta replace the whole board.

On the other hand, you get all the weight and space savings and in a way simplicity of just having to order one thing.

The built in vtx and receiver antennas are guided out the sides of the canopy - there are plenty of holes and options how to get that done.

The camera is the RunCam Nano 3. It's a really good CMOS camera for its size and comes it at only 1.2g. You can adjust the camera angle via 2 screws on the sides of the canopy. And possible adjusting the foam padding placed under the camera to combat jello which it does, but not 100% successfully (as you can see in some of my outdoor sample footage).

[TODO: camera close up and foam close up]

The flight controller board is the **Crazybee F4FR Lite** in my case, where the FR part stands to tell it's the FrSky version with built in SPI based FrSky receiver. It can only handle 1S batteries so don't even think about 2S (although the motors wouldn't handle that either).

The receiver is gonna get you about up to a couple hundred meters max [TODO: insert miles]. The ESCs are rated for 5A continuos current. The on-board VTX outputs only at 25mW and can be controlled via Smartaudio (through the OSD).

The micro USB port is easily accessible and the whole board is mounted to the frame with rubber grommets to dampen vibrations.

Overall, especially for being a fairly cheap product, the components are of good quality and the execution and build and very well done. Bonus points for twisting around sticking between the frame the power leads, instead of just leading them out straight from the battery pads. This helps reduce tugging tension on them, which is unlikely but might occur if your battery flies out of the mounting bay mid flight.

### ‚öô <span id="setup" class="offset-top-nav">Setup</span>

TODO: Extract the Betaflight config dump before proceeding

**üîó Bind the receiver to a radio**

The Mobula6 comes with a printed manual, but you can also [get it online in pdf form][4].

**üëÄ Check the Betaflight configuration**

> It's always a good idea to save a copy of your stock configuration. That's easy to do by connecting your quad to Betaflight, going to the CLI tab and typing the `dump` command. That's gonna list all of the quad's configuration. You can then click the `Save to file` button to save yourself a backup copy, before making any changes to the config.

If you didn't do that, I've done that for you - here is the [stock Mobula6 Betaflight configuration](BTFL_cli_Mobula_6_stock.txt).

- the 300mah eachine battery label and print on the battery itself dont match C rating.

- create a table with flying times comparisons:
- paste a pic of the table
- paste screenshots of video endings with stats

without ESC flashing: 300mah stock | 300 mah eachine | 450 GNB / 450 emax

with ESC flashing: 300mah stock | 300 mah eachine | 450 GNB / 450 emax

#### Maiden flight, stock 300mah battery

#### Eachine 300mah battery

Mention the labeled vs real C rating, add pictures

#### Outdoors

- Flight time comparison stab vs acro mode
- Flight time comparison with different batteries
- Flight time comparison with 48kHz mod

### üîù <span id="upgrades" class="offset-top-nav">Upgrades</span>

- 48 kHz mod! Flight time comparison
- Props?

- the new Betaflight battery connector for another 10% minmaxing boost

IF you really wanna MINMAX, remove the plugs and solder the motors directly.
