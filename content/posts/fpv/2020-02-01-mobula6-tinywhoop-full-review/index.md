It's a truly great time for our FPV racing and freestyle hobby. For one, we get to enjoy a pretty rapid rate of tech improvement. Even though I've been into FPV drones for about a little under 3 years, it never seizes to amaze me how much things have changed.

The [Mobula 6][1] micro drone is a living embodiment of these rapid changes. It's a very well executed product, and at only 20g it's easily one of the smallest and lightest micro drones out there, that still flies and feels like a bigger drone and not like a toy.

I've been buying and trying Happymodel's products since the Snapper7 a few years back, and have never been disappointed with them. The [Mobula7 HD][5] was a particular favorite of mine from 2019, and I'm still planning to try out the [Larva X HD][6] a bit later this year too.

That's all just to say that while I do like Happymodel, I will be, as always, telling things as they are and not be fanboying around. This is not a paid advertisement, just my experience with the Mobula6.

TODO: Extract the Betaflight config dump before proceeding

**üîó Bind the receiver to a radio**

The Mobula6 comes with a printed manual, but you can also [get it online in pdf form here][4].

**üëÄ Check the Betaflight configuration**

> It's always a good idea to save a copy of your stock configuration. That's easy to do by connecting your quad to Betaflight, going to the CLI tab and typing the `dump` command. That's gonna list all of the quad's configuration. You can then click the `Save to file` button to save yourself a backup copy, before making any changes to the config.

If you didn't do that, I've done that for you - here is the [stock Mobula6 Betaflight configuration](BTFL_cli_Mobula_6_stock.txt).

### üöÅ <span id="flying" class="offset-top-nav">Flying</span>
