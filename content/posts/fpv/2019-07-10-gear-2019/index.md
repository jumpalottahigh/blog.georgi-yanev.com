### 🤓 <span id="goggles">Goggles & antennas</span>

- [Skyzone SKY02X][1] 🔥

> Will start testing the Skyzone goggles in July 2019 and will update this post accordingly when I have more to share.

- [AOMWAY Commander][3] 🔥

![aomway commander goggles](gear-2019-3.jpg)

> Been using the Aomway Commanders for over a year and I love them. Great value, in terms of what you get for how much you pay. Bonus points for being a complete package - comes with a built-in diversity receiver module. No need to buy your own module on top of buying the goggles.

- [Aomway 5.8GHz FPV 4 Leaf Clover Antenna][9] 🔥

![aomway clover leaf antenna](gear-2019-5.jpg)

- [Realacc Triple Feed Patch Antenna][2] 🔥

![realacc triple feed patch antenna](gear-2019-4.jpg)

- [Pagoda 60mm 5.8G 2dBi FPV Antenna][13]

- [RP-SMA Female right angle connector][36] or [SMA Female right angle connector][37]

![antenna angle bracket](gear-2019-6.jpg)

> So you don't have to bend your antennas again.

All those antenna options are pretty solid, been using some of those for almost 2 years, still no issues.

### 📡 <span id="transmitters" class="offset-top-nav">Transmitters</span>

- [FrSky Taranis X-Lite][4] 🔥

![Taranis X-Lite](gear-2019-7.jpg)

> I started testing the X-Lite on April 6th, 2019 and kind of switched to it as my main radio since then. It's actually a pretty awesome radio with a different form factor than most traditional radios, but also full-featured. [Read the full review and set up guide][28].

- [FrSky Taranis Q X7][5] 🔥

![Taranis Q X7](gear-2019-8.jpg)

> I loved my Taranis Q X7, used it for over a year, recently switched to X-Lite, but might still fly my Q X7 every once in a while, it's still a great radio and an awesome value for money. [How to set up the Taranis Q X7][29].

### 🚁 <span id="drones" class="offset-top-nav">Drones</span>

- [Emax Hawk 5][24] 🔥🔥🔥 (mini quad)

![Emax Hawk 5 with RunCam 5](gear-2019-9.jpg)

> Started testing the Emax Hawk 5 in June 2019. I immediately fell in love with the tune and the Avan Flow 5 props on it. The quad itself has high-quality parts, the build quality is very good and the tune is outstanding. Great value for money and a highly recommended purchase for beginners and more advanced pilots alike. [Read the full review and setup guide][30].

- [Mobula7 HD][11] 🔥🔥🔥 (micro 2S / 3S quad, cinewhoop)

![Mobula7 HD with Gemfan props](gear-2019-10.jpg)

![Mobula7 HD in case with a lot of BetaFPV 2S 350 mah batteries](gear-2019-11.jpg)

> The Mobula7 HD was my first `cinewhoop`, my 2nd quad from HappyModel, and my 4th micro drone. I absolutely love flying it! Even though it's a micro quad, it flies really almost like a 5-inch quad. You can fly it safely in parks and playgrounds and even somewhat close around other people without being scared of injuring anyone. [Read my full review and setup guide][31] or [Watch the video review on FPVTIPS][32].

- [Eachine Wizard X220][6] 🔥🔥 (mini quad)

![Eachine Wizard x220](gear-2019-12.jpg)

> I have crashed my wizard so many times, as it was my learning quad, and [I have swapped out so many of its parts][33] that it is hardly a wizard anymore. Nevertheless, I still love flying it.

- [Eachine Trashcan][7] 🔥🔥 (micro 1S / 2S quad)

![Eachine Trashcan](gear-2019-13.jpg)

> I loved flying my Trashcan last winter. [Read the full review][34].

### 🔩 <span id="custom-builds" class="offset-top-nav">Custom Build Drone "Phoenix" Parts:</span>

> This was my first quad build from 2018, still alive and kicking and I still love flying it! The parts list is below. It will cost you about \$270 to build in parts alone. You can definitely build for cheaper, but this build was focused on good value high-quality components. [Read about my experience building this quad][35].
