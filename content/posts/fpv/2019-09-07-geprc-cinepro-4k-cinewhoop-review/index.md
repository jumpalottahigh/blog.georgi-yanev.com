It seemed to me that on the cinewhoop front, there have been a lot of advancements lately, in particular, models such as the [GEPRC CinePro][1] that carry a [Caddx Tarsier 4K camera][2] with 2 separate sensors, definitely catch the eye and excite me. In this review and setup guide we're gonna have a look at the **advanced version** of this drone with the [FrSky XM+ receiver][5] (BNF).

One of the quads I've flown the most during 2019 is the [Mobula7 HD][6] (which **I absolutely love flying!** - just [look at the number of videos in that playlist on my channel][7]). And while in general I prefer and started with 5 inch drones, there's something super cool about being able to whip this little quad out and just fly it in a park without disturbing other people. My only desire with the Mobula7 HD was to just have a full range receiver, as the built in SPI based receiver only gets you about 100 meters or so. **This was the other main reason why I was very curious to test the GEPRC CinePro as it comes with a full range receiver**.

Whether you are a cinewhoop veteran, or just considering getting into cinewhooping, I think you will find this post useful. Let's get to it!

### üì¶ <span id="unboxing">Unboxing</span>

When I think of the [GEPRC CinePro 4K][1] cinewhoop unboxing experience, I think of two things: **minimalistic and high quality gear**.

![GEPRC CinePro box](geprc-cinepro-4k-cinewhoop-review-1.jpg)

Once you open the box, you are immediately presented the quad, which looks like a piece of art, but more on that in a sec.

![GEPRC CinePro in its box](geprc-cinepro-4k-cinewhoop-review-2.jpg)

The quad is wrapped in this protective film.

![GEPRC CinePro wrapped in plastic](geprc-cinepro-4k-cinewhoop-review-3.jpg)

You get a card with a VTX frequency table ...

![VTX frequency table](geprc-cinepro-4k-cinewhoop-review-4.jpg)

... some stickers, a couple of velcro straps, antenna tubes and an extra set of spare props. Those props are [Dalprop Cyclone Q2035C][3], quad blade high quality propellers. The props that the quad comes with already installed are also high quality - [Emax Avan 2 inch][4]. Both sets offer very different flight experiences, as we'll see a bit later.

![GEPRC CinePro spare props, stickers and velcro straps](geprc-cinepro-4k-cinewhoop-review-5.jpg)

The components are very high quality, the quad is gorgeous and the assembly work - top notch. Shiny solder joins, well placed antennas and shrink wrap, really superb build quality, which is great, given that the [GEPRC CinePro 4K][1] comes with a price tag of about \$270.

### üìù <span id="specs" class="offset-top-nav">Specifications</span>

Sturdy high-quality carbon fiber frame. TODO: measure arm sizes?

![GEPRC CinePro front right view](geprc-cinepro-4k-cinewhoop-review-7.jpg)

Thick plastic prop guards, not flimsy at all. The props are secured with 2 screws each. Also note that this quad comes configured in **props out** mode, so pay attention to that if you are swapping props.

I personally fly almost all my quads in what I believe also to be more common **props in** setup.

![GEPRC CinePro front right view close up](geprc-cinepro-4k-cinewhoop-review-8.jpg)

Metal cage to protect the Caddx Tarsier 4K camera, which is easily the star of this whole show üíÉ.

As you can tell the camera tilt is not at all aggressive which is somewhat expected when we are talking about a cinewhoop, as the goal is probably not so much to rip packs like crazy, but rather capture slower, more cinematic footage.

Plenty of space on top for mounting a battery, as well as 2 slits for guiding the velcro straps through.

![GEPRC CinePro facing left, top down view](geprc-cinepro-4k-cinewhoop-review-9.jpg)

Receiver antennas mounted on the front arms, pointing backwards, at a 90 degree angle to each other üíô.

![GEPRC CinePro back shot](geprc-cinepro-4k-cinewhoop-review-10.jpg)

Back VTX whip antenna away from the props and won't get caught in them. The VTX supports up to 500 mW. XT30 plug for batteries.

The motors are the GEP-GR1105 5000KV and the recommended battery is a 4S lipo for those.

![GEPRC CinePro motors shot](geprc-cinepro-4k-cinewhoop-review-11.jpg)

Two separate camera sensors, one for the FPV feed and one dedicated for 4K or HD video recording.

And here is the FrSky XM plus receiver, ziptied under the camera boards.
