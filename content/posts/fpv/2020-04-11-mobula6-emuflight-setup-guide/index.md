In 2020 most of our quads fly on [Betaflight][3]. That's a fact. However there are some other options out there (EmuFlight, Cleanflight, Butterflight to name a few).

But if you have already made up your mind, in this short guide, I want to show you how to flash [EmuFlight][4] on your Mobula6 (but you could do that to many other quads too), and how to setup the [Project Mockingbird][6] config.

![Mobula6 with EmuFlight and Project Mockingbird](mobula6-emuflight-setup-guide-1.png)

In this example I'm gonna be using my [Mobula6][1] (Bonus points if you already followed the [JESC firmware guide in my original review post][2]).

### <span id="what-is-emuflight">‚ùî What is EmuFlight?</span>

[EmuFlight][4] is a Betaflight fork, that implements some more opinionated features and some people claim that it really improves how their quads fly out of the box on stock config. I hear that even more regarding small micro drones.

I'm not gonna try to convince you to move your entire fleet to EmuFlight (and I'm definitely not going to do that myself) but I figured it might be interesting to try out and experiment with, and the Mobula6 is in many ways the perfect candidate to do that.

If you want to learn more about EmuFlight I recommend watching [Joshua Bardwell's interview with Kevin Plaizier][5].

### <span id="what-is-project-mockingbird" class="offset-top-nav">‚ùî What is Project Mockingbird?</span>

As far as Project Mockingbird goes, it claims to deliver the best angle mode config for your brushed whoops. Project Mockingbird can be setup with Betaflight as well (EmuFlight is not a requirement), it's basically a bunch of configuration to make your whoops fly even more awesome.

Project Mockingbird is strictly a whoop / micro drone project. You can join the community in their [Facebook group][7].

### üîΩ Download Emuflight and config files

Grab Emuflight and install it from here ...

Get this hex and this diff file ...

[EmuFlight_0.2.0_CRAZYBEEF4FR.hex](EmuFlight_0.2.0_CRAZYBEEF4FR.hex)
[EMUF_215_PMB-FF-BASE-DIFF-ALL-PUBLIC-01-09-20](EMUF_215_PMB-FF-BASE-DIFF-ALL-PUBLIC-01-09-20.txt)

### üíæ Flash Emuflight

- Flash it
- Potential issues and ImpulseRC driver fixer
- Flashing successfully and realising that is the wrong hex, don't do it

### üìã Paste or load the diff

### ‚öô Validate and adjust the settings

- Props in vs Props out
- SPI receiver settings to \_D
- Modes - add channels
- Receiver - TAER from w/e it was
- OSD elements if you want any

### üöÅ Flying

#### Indoor flights

Initial immediate impression - yaw axis is super sensitive and responsive, at the same time, pitch axis seems too slow.
Need to get in more flights. There's something nice about the tune. The flight time does not seem to suffer, need more tests.

#### Outdoor flights

Self host the hex and txt with diff

### üìù Conclusion

Take it for what it is and have fun with it. This might not be for everyone and I'm not sure it's a matter of if this is really the one true set up.
I've been hearing of many people getting very decent results with Betaflight 4.1 which allows filtering. At the same time, I really can't complain how the quad flew on 3.5.7 either. I was pretty happy with it. I really mostly did this upgrade out of curiosity, to learn something new, to share it with you folks and to see if it was really as good as some people claimed it to be.

If you feel like trying it out, go for it, if not, enjoy your Mobula as it is. On the other hand, you can always flash back to Betaflight and paste in the stock config.

Whatever you choose, have fun and happy flying!
