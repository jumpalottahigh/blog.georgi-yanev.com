I really love these [yearly][] [reflection][] [posts][] and I am really looking forward to writing them every year. Not because I want to pat myself on the back or brag over stuff, but really because they show me in a very clear way what had happened and what had changed in the semi-long run.
These posts uncover a lot of small details invisible to the naked eye on a daily basis, and it is very important to acknowledge what had gone well and what progress you have made in a specific area. This leads to reduced stress and anxiety levels, less feeling of failure and allows you to take a deep breath and chart out the roadmap for the next year.

I encourage you to try this out for yourself and see if it helps you realise how much you have achieved and what to focus on next. This post is structured such that topics are group, while still maintaining rough chronological order of how events transpired throughout the year.

Let’s do this!

I'm very fortunate to have a good job I love, interesting hobbies and side business that seems to be doing well. But the single most important thing is my family - my wife and son. They mean everything to me and are the sole inspiring of everything I do. This blog post is dedicated to you Sofi and Anton.

This is what I ended up doing in 2019:

Writing a book - wrote 13 chapters of it, kept refining the story and polishing the ideas
Gave 2 talks at tech meet ups
Gave multiple workshops on modern JavaScript and React at F-Secure
Produced a TON of content to my blog which lead to a lot of growth - powered by collaboration with Banggood
Traveled to Plovdiv
Read more books than usual
Steady upload of flight footage to my now secondary YouTube channel gave me a lot of practice with the whole process
Started a new YouTube channel - FPVTIPS on the 23rd of June
Had an amazing summer in Finland - going to so many places with my son and wife
Started a new job and already learned so much from it and excited about so much more
Learned a lot about video editing and production

Taking ownership and making stuff happen
My single advice to you this year is on pro-activity. You have the power to shape your career in many different ways. It might take some time, but with consistency and effort you can do it. In my case, I’m talking about my career as a software engineer and in particular the example of my work at F-Secure as a web developer.
I started at the company as a summer trainee and went through a few steps and contract extension to end up totally spending 4 years and 3 months of my life there. I loved it for the better part! This year, on September 13th was my last at F-Secure.

I could easily (and probably will) write an entire separate blog post on lessons learned from my job at F-Secure, so instead, I’ll focus here mostly on the straight to the point conclusions. During my time at F-Secure I was fortunate enough to have had the support of my direct managers, which helped drive initiatives close to my heart that were business impacting. I’ve been involved in a number of projects I’m very happy to have been a part of, which gave me the opportunity to learn more, improve my skills and ship products. [TODO: examples]
My last “Hail Mary” at the job was the migration of our campaign web pages to a modern Gatsby + Netlify stack, the development of 2 React open source libraries of shared componets and icons.
So in the beginning of the year, because winter in Finland is long and brutal, it’s a great opportunity to do indoors stuff and focus on one’s coding career. I was streaming live on Twitch coding on side projects, and decided I’d give my first talk at a local JavaScript meet up. I ended up giving two talks. Worked on my slides for nearly 2 months.
My book writing adventure
So I’ve been [preparing for my book][2] writing adventure during this year’s [NaNoWriMo][] and I … failed. Let me elaborate. The goal is simple - write 50 000 words during the month of November. And I failed because I didn’t write 50 000 words. I wrote 4 000 and stopped. Now I can go on to explain that I got sick, on top of doing extra hours at a new job (which is a cognitive demand on another level in and of itself), but the fact is that had I wanted to, I could have pushed and done it.

**I made a conscious decision to stop.** Not because I was lazy, not because I couldn’t have done, but because I believe that it’s ok to drop things when you decide it’s good for you in the long term, and to prioritize other things over.

**You can’t plan everything in life and this year for me was a perfect example why.** And that’s ok. In fact, that makes things a bit more fun too. I love planning and having a rough idea of where I wanna go, but how I get there and what I go through, I want that to be partially a surprise, an adventure.

**Stay mentally sane and don’t push yourselves over the limit. It’s ok to drop things and re-prioritize as you go along.**

If you’re wondering what’s next for my book writing project, I’m happy to say I haven’t shelved it or dropped it completely. I will continue working on it, write weekly a small target, but consistently. I love how the stories and characters are really taking shape in my head now that I’ve kept thinking about the main plot, setting and characters for roughly a year. I’m

[Where it went well and where it’s ok to drop things]

Software engineering and web development
TODO:
This year has been truly interesting. From giving talks and implementing Gatsby and Netlify at scale during my time at F-Secure, to producing a [component library][], an [icon library][] and more…. I did a lot of React and I loved it. I also did a lot of architecting, which was nice.
Then about new job

Health is important and has to be one of my next focus areas
