### "The best dad and double down on CrossFit skills"

The obvious reason why I enjoy doing these retrospectives is that many times when you look back, it's a very motivating way of recognizing the progress in something. It feels great. There's another side to it however. Sometimes you look back and you notice how things have changed - you didn't go for the initial plans you had, instead you went for something else, new or old, but either way taking priority and becoming a focus over the planned items. And that's ok too. In the end, life is about the journey, it's about enjoying it and making sure we live everyday as we would like, as much as possible.

- <span class="highlight-danger">🚙 Rent an RV (Adventure 2)</span>
- <span class="highlight-success">🛳️ Go on a longer boat cruise (Adventure 3)</span>

After taking a look at the major goals for 2023, set in 2022, let's expand a little bit. Unfortunately monthly budget has not been improved to be on at least neutral state. There's been a number of bigger "home upgrade" type of improvements, and the trips to Germany, Spain and Sweden, definitely impacted the budget as well. I can't say that I overspent on something I didn't need, for the most part, spending on some travel and experiences is always worth it. There are certainly some items I could have done without, like some massages here and there, but they were helpful for training recovery. The biggest "win" however, was the apartment move in February 2023, when I started paying 1000e rent instead of 1400e, so that's great.

This also brings us to the 2nd point in the list - moving to live closer to Anton's school. This worked out really well, and coupled with the fact that for the first time in many years we got warm weather from early April, it enabled many of football, basketball and just in general hanging out on the sports premises of the school after school with Anton. Very fun, and very nice! Anton has been also signed up to a hobby where they tried different types of ball games, and also to an ice hockey hobby, so those went well too and he's having fun with them, which is amazing!

Becoming "full stack" and making 6 new projects, it's a nice thought, but there never was time for this. At one point I even recall making this calendar view, where I plotted all the hours I'm doing something, just to give myself clarity, and it becomes immediately obvious that it's very challenging to say the least to "create time" for something bigger like that:

![example weekly calendar](my-2023-year-in-review-2.png)

And I know the image is "washed out" and whatever, but anyway, the point is that when you plot in a weekly calendar the time spent sleeping, working, crossfitting (including extra minutes after class to work on skills and commute times), then a few raid nights per week with the boys and finally an hour or so of watching YouTube videos and relaxing before bed, there's really not much left. And that example is on a week Anton is with his mom, things are quite different when he's home with me.
What a long way of finding an excuse for yourself for not doing some of the extra things? Nah, that comes from me - someone who deeply believes that **if you really wanted to do something, you would do it**. Anyway, there was just no way to prioritize and spend time with those potential full stack hobby projects.

As far as joining more communities and people with similar interests, and also perhaps a latin dance class - I still find that interesting, I'd still want to do it, and if I see the right opportunity I might, but honestly, not even as an excuse, **time is a factor**. There are time and logistical constraints to what is possible each week. Who knows in the future though. Cause the thing is, that kind of music does fill my heart in a very special way and makes me feel so good and alive. Why not try learning to dance and be with other like minded people, it might work out someday.

On embracing discomfort head on, the point was to not necessarily always try to make everything super comfortable. Many times, I'd go out of my way to preplan everything to such a degree, so there would be near 0 chance of any (unwanted) surprises. **The problem is, this also gets rid of the nice, pleasant surprises**. So this extends on the idea of being present, in the moment, living, smiling, enjoying, chatting, looking, talking. I've not marked this as green, cause there wasn't some resounding success, and I am still very VERY guilty of planning and preplanning everything to a crazy extent, but I am aware, and I am definitely very consciously working on it. We'll get there.

I did manage to travel to Spain and my 2nd wildcard adventure ended up being a trip to Berlin, actually that happened even before the Spanish trip. I'll expand on those below in their dedicated sections. "Rent an RV" did not happen, but there's a big chance of it happening next year, because one of the things I learnt this year was how much fun was the trip with Anton on the boat cruise to Sweden! He's such a big boy, ready for adventure and we both had so much fun, to this day he keeps saying that was the best day of his life. I'll expand a lot more on that below too, because I have a lot of thoughts about it.

#### ◻️ Minor goals:

- <span class="highlight-danger">🇪🇸 Sign up for a Spanish language class</span>
- <span class="highlight-danger">🇸🇪 Sign up for a Swedish language class?</span>
- <span class="highlight-danger">🇫🇮 Finnish citizenship?</span>
- <span class="highlight-danger">📺 Stream once a week on Twitch</span>
- <span class="highlight-danger">💵 Diversify income streams (platforms build up, year 2/5)</span>
- <span class="highlight-success">🛋 Cozy and comfy in the new apartment</span>
- <span class="highlight-danger">🎶 Create 1 hip hop or or techno / EDM song</span>

The main underlying "excuse" for most of the above not happening, is the same reason I described above - time and I suppose not making them a priority. The thing is, those things are hard to take presedence over something like focusing on my training or spending time with my kid in a present and active manner. They are some decent ideas in there, but yeah, this year was not the year they would happen.

### 2️⃣0️⃣2️⃣3️⃣

#### 🏋️‍♂️ CrossFit! Double down on skills!

This might be one of the biggest topics of 2023 for me. Something happened and from liking and enjoying CrossFit I went full in love with it and beyond. February this year marked the 1 year of CrossFit anniversary for me. I was already plenty fired up from the previous year, some lifting numbers were progressing, some skills were too, but a lot of skills were lacking too.

Then came the CrossFit Open. An yearly event (I had no clue about), that some folks from the gym said I should sign up for, and the idea is simple - you pay 20 bucks, and you do 3 workouts in 3 consequtive weeks, which are plenty challenging, but also not too crazy. Then you get scores and that's getting added to your profile. Of course, the best athletes use that as qualifiers for the CrossFit Quarterfinals, then the CrossFit Semifinals and finally the CrossFit Games.

Due to time constraints there was no way I could do all 3 events sadly, so I missed the first one, but I did do the 2nd of the 3 CrossFit Open workouts, and boy did that excite me! We did it together with Matt, judging for each other. The workout was about doing 5 burpee pull ups (increasing by 5 each round) and then 10 shuttle runs of about 10 meter each give or take. I did well for myself and I was happy with my result, although I'm sure I could do a lot better nowadays 😀 **But that workout sparked up a fire**. I've always been competitive but now knowing about this event, it really got me hungry for more.

Then came the 3rd event and I thought I'd love to do it, even though it would be hard to organize the time for me to do it. **The only thing I was hoping for, was that there wouldn't be any double unders, as I could do no double unders at all**. Then, the event got announced and there were double unders involved 😂. So I couldn't do it, but **that then took the spark I mentioned above and turned it into a fire**. I decided I really need to start working on my skills and that I'd like to compete in some (however small) form at some point.

A couple more things put extra fuel in that fire. Watching Mal O'Brien ABSOLUTELY KILL the 23.3 - the third CrossFit open event, inspired me like nothing else... It was just about that determination and the push she went through the entire thing with. There was a moment around that time when watching her do the wall walks and the strict handstand push ups, insprired me super much and soon I was working hard on improving those, and actually saw a TON of progress in them. There were other examples of inspiring people, many from our gym, and at that time I also started watching older versions of the CrossFit games, so definitely kept an eye on a lot of the famous athletes and getting cues on how they did specific movements and so on.

TODO:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS7M6s2xXfs&t=549s

The last piece of the puzzle was when I asked Charli, the owner of our gym, if it would be ok to do extra time before or after classes and he said it would be ok. So, my format, ever since about March 2023 till this day, has been **"go for the crossfit class, and whenever possible, spend 30 extra minutes after working on skills"**.

And it all started with extra work on double unders, cause I was so annoyed I couldn't do them. Not even 1 or 2 in a row. I whipped my hands quite a lot, and my legs too, but slowly and steadily I went from nothing to the first 5, that felt insane. Now I'm at a point of doing most times about 13 before tripping, and have done a few times 20+ or even 30. I'm proud of it, but of course it requires a lot more work and I'm here for it.

**In fact, that's the best part about CrossFit - all these skills you can work on and learn, it's so much fun!.**

Then came handstand walk work around April / May and beyond. Every time after class, when I could, I was practicing. And it worked out! Over months and months, I can now say that something, which was unthinkable to me earlier, I can now walk some meters on my hands. That too still needs work, to be even better and faster at it, but the progress has been huge. Actually, those and strict handstand push ups have been one of my biggest strengths. Additionally I learnt how to do the kipping version of HSPUs too, which was something I thought I'd never do, but hey here we are.

Finally, in the summer I started getting some ring muscle ups and that was super exciting! I went from nothing to sometimes doing 4 in a row kipping, and many times 2s and 3s. This is something that also needs more work, but I'm happy I'm able to chug a few on a good day after class, it feels great. Just getting some reps in and working on it!

And the latest, just as of mid November or so - butterfly pull ups. I got a bit afraid of this, thinking it's gonna take quite a while to get used to it, but somehow, something clicked and I already used them for the first time in a workout, which felt amazing! Got a lot of good tips there from Ville, Elisa, Ida, which really helped me a lot!

So while, there's still tons to work on, more strength to be built, a lot more technique and practice, it feels kind of really nice that this year I went from not being able to do so many things, to now having every crossfit skill necessary. I'm still super excited about the work and improving, because make no mistake, I'm far from perfect, there's a lot more to be desired, but it feels good, that I can at least do the movements!

#### 🏃‍♂️Embracing running

During my first year of CrossFit I recognized getting better at running was not my priority. There was a lot to learn in CrossFit, a lot fun to be had and running wasn't among the top interesting things. In 2023, a couple of things changed. First, I recognized that I should really get at least a bit more comfortable and better at running. During one of the partner competitions in our gym in November 2022, while running with a friend, I wish I was at least a bit better, to be at least not slowing us down. Additionally, in early 2023, I started thinking about someday potentially training for and doing the Iron Man triathlon challenge.
I started watching a few YouTube channels that provided more specific information on running and Iron Man, the most influential to me being Natasha O'cean 's channel. I learnt a lot and got inspired a lot from her channel. Finally, the weather was very favorable in early April, and so, running it was.
Started off slow with a few shorter barely 3k runs, I think my first run was 2k in 16mins with a pace of 8:27 per km, very slow and very "easy". There must have been some walking on that one. The 2nd run was already 2.2km in 13min 44s with 6:15 pace a week later, then another 2.38km in 14m42s with a 6:11 pace.
My last short run was a 3.17km in 18m12s with 5:44 pace. Then I moved on to a bit slower, but lengthier runs aiming for 5-6k. I did a 5.94k in 37m30s with 6:19 pace, then:

- 6:09km in 38m55s with 6:23 pace on May 21
- 6.38km in 37m19s with 5:50 pace on June 11
- 5.02km in 27m8s with 5:24 pace on July 29

The good news is that I improved a lot, getting pretty comfy with running 5ks. The bad news is that as you can tell from the dates, the runs got really spread out and there wasn't much running since. Definitely will continue working on and improving next year, **the goal will be to get very comfy running 10k with a pretty decent pace**.

There were a couple more noteworthy mentions when it comes down to running, first during the Murph hero WOD in May, there is 2 x 1 mile run in it, and I was pretty ok this year with that, so I'm happy for that. The other thing worth mentioning was the **Helsinki Tough Viking obstacle course race** I took part in September.

#### 🥈 Helsinki Tough Viking

It was a lot of fun, a lot of the challenges were easy to overcome, when it came down to climbing onto something, ladders or using upperbody strength to muscle up onto a platform, carrying logs, metal tanks, etc. There were a couple of "climber" challenges where you had to hold onto very tiny things, those were tricky for me, and of course the hard 80kg ball shaped weight was tricky, if it were a sandbag with that weight, I'd have no problem. I was very concerned with the parts of the race that dip you into the cold water and definitely the icebath dive and go under in the end. I'm very proud of myself how I dealt with these, it was very doable, it was a bit cold, but definitely doable, the weather was favorable with sun shining on a decently warm day for September. The icebath, when I got to it, together with one other girl, It was nice to have that "pseudo company" for support, but basically I decided not to think about it, so I just immediatelly sad on the edge, then just plunged in and dove underneath and popped on the other side and jumped out. I just remember not remembering anything from it, as it all just blacked out, it was very cold, but ok, some deep breathes and it was over, and so was the race. My time? Kinda bad - 1 hour 45 minutes. Main reason - calf cramps like no other from the 8th to the 10th km of the race. Which also was the reason for my disappointment on not making that 1 very high platform in the end, cause I could just not run at my full speed and reach it. I'm surprised and happy I attempted it at all given the condition I was in. I kinda hoped the cold water would help with the cramps but it did not, very weird, because I thought I should have been ok, I had loaded up on carbs the night before, had enough electrolytes, maybe I should have had more electrolytes DURING the race, I'll prepare for that next time, but I really wanna run this again without getting the cramps, im sure I could do at least 1 hour 15 minutes that way. With some luck maybe even sub 1 hour. Anyway I'm still happy and proud of this!

#### ☀️ Finnish weather in 2023, a rare long spring + summer

I'm really not the biggest fan of Finnish weather. Everyone who knows me, knows that. And anyone who tries to convince other people that Finnish weather is nice, is high on something. That's not my subjective opinion, that's a fact.
However, this year, for the first time of the at least past 11 years since I've been here, spring really came early and came to stay which is even more important. We are not talking about occasionally warm day, temperatures actually got nice and warm in April and stayed that way, that was a very big deal, because it's so rare, but also coincided with my running efforts, so it played a major role in me being inspired to run, but also having the capability to do so (and no, I don't care you can run in all kinds of weather with the right gear, I'm not there, and I don't care for that).

It would have been nice if summer lasted longer and the autumn would have been extra warm too, which sadly was not the case, but I'm not complaining and I'm very happy. **I need a lot more April to be warm, then October**. That's most important for my sanity while living in Finland, because every year the hardest time for me is the March / April period - a time when all my friends living in warmer places start posting pictures wearing t-shirts in a sunny day with flowers and blossoming trees around them and here everything is still frozen solid, and even having temperatures sub zero and occasionally even -15 to -25 on a March day is not unheard of. It's the sad reality of Finish weather. **Unfortunately for me, at that time of the year after 6 months of cold weather and winter, I'm so worn out that I just can't deal with it anymore!** I'm beyond ready for some nice warm weather!

This all just to provide context on why weather being so good from early on this year was so important for me. That and the fact that we had moved apartments to live a lot closer to my son's school, enabled some really awesome fun times! Like nearly everyday I'd pick him up from preschool at the time we would go to play football in the field right next to his school, or climb and do muscle ups, or do dips, or later on also play some basketball. **Such a nice time and a nice feeling - me, my kid, some sporty activity, nice warm weather, so, so good!**

#### 🍸 On being sober for over a year

Quitting alcohol and admitting to myself I quit was an interesting one. Now, it's hard to attribute this solely to 2023 itself, but let's say the main change manifested here and the recognition of the fact that I had quit. **But why? Well, this had been a long time coming...**

I suppose in a way this had begun already to some degree 7-8 years ago when my kid was born, because I had hardly been "hardcore" drinking since and going out drinking had been pretty rare. Obviously the focus was on becoming a dad and I genuinely wanted to be home and spend time with my son, even in some work outings and other occasions. Not drinking was also supported by the fact that I live far from the city, so I have to drive and one thing that I notice early on, was that despite I used to think you need to drink to have fun during parties, the few times I went to some not drink, if the company was right, it was still a lot of fun, so drinking was not really required.

Another thing that played a role was that I was not necessarily tempted to drink, cause I've had my 20s pretty wildly with many different parties and heavy drinking, so it's not something I was gonna miss out on - I had done it for years, so settling down and calming down was actually a nice change of pace.

So for quite a while the only "drinking" I was really doing was basically a couple of beers on the weekend. In august 2022, however, I asked myself randomly one day at the shop, hey, what if these beers are just a product of habit, do you really want them? Do you really enjoy, _enjoy_ them? So I ran an experiment that I didn't buy weekly beers, and **much to my surprise, I have not purchased a single beer, wine or any other type of alcohol from the shop since August 2022**. Kinda funny like that lol.

So with all of that context in mind, and understanding where I was at in the beginning of 2023, what happened then? Well, although I stopped buying alcohol at all, I didn't consider myself as I had "quit drinking". Going out with friends, I'd still have some drink, usually I'd enjoy a nice whisky sour or an old fashioned. But the thing is, something that happened in March 2023 led me to admit to myself that I had actually quit drinking. We had a company organized hackathon, and we had a great time, I had a really solid team, we chatted and had fun building things, and in the first evening there was some IPA beers. I used to enjoy IPAs in my past. I wondered if I should have one, I decided you know what, let's go for one. I had 2 sips exactly, and I put it away. I just didn't enjoy it and I almost felt weird about it, but it was really time to admit, that I had quit. It sounded weird in my mind, but I tried not to think about it much, just let myself be and see how it goes. But, yep, I had quit drinking, apparently.

![IPA bottle and quitting drinking](my-2023-year-in-review-4.jpg)

To understand additionally why this is so weird and such a big deal to me, you do have to understand that while I was never a super heavy addicted drinker, I did have my party years during which we did drink a lot and enjoyed it too. I enjoyed nice whiskeys too. I also was a passionate smoker and really loved that, but after 11 years of smoking, I had quit 8 years ago when my son's mom got pregnant. In the end I believe in "phases in life" and that's how I've experienced mine. There are different phases and times for everything. And that's ok and provides diversity and it's nice. Don't overthink it 😀.

Finally I'd lie if I said that learning about alcohol being detrimental to gains from workouts didn't influence my decision as well. I love the progress I've made in CrossFit, I love that sport and all the fun things you can do, I enjoy it a lot, and yeah that's another additional thing to help me quit. The thing is, quitting something or starting to go to the gym or starting any other type of habit - **it has to come from within and with a drive**. No one else can make you do it, no one else can do it for you. You just have to feel like you want to do it, like you need to do it, and allow yourself to go for it. Yes, external support helps a lot, but the drive must come from within. That's at least how I feel about it.

In the end I'm happy with this change, I enjoy it a lot, and I'm also not putting any hard restrictions on it, if I wanna have some drinks I will. But honestly, most likely I won't in most cases 😅.

#### 🇩🇪 Trip to Berlin, Germany and the CrossFit semifinals 2023

I'm really happy with my travels this year! I wished to go to a couple of new destinations and I did just that. The Berlin trip specifically was for an event - the European part of the CrossFit semifinals. It was such an actually awesome experience! Anyway, at that point in time (this happened in early June), I had really gotten into CrossFit with my extra practice work on skills and what not, I was watching a lot of the previous years worth of competitions with many various CrossFit athletes, so it was so nice to see some of them live! Like Laura Horvath, Annie Thorisdottir, Jonne Koski, and a TON of other ones, I'm not gonna make a whole list, I appreciate every one of them showing up and competing and inspiring us fans!

My day would start everyday around 8 or so in the morning with a breakfast in the hotel I was staying at, followed by a nice 30 minute walk to the competition venue. It was very chill. The day would start, it would be exciting to watch the different events, then I would have lunch and go back to watching. **The best, most special part, however, was on 2 of the 4 days I participated in the CrossFit Throwdown and it was absolutely amazing!**

Not only was the throwdown actually pretty cheap to participate in, something like 12e or so, but it gave us a chance to do similar workouts (to some degree) as what had been happening on the competition floor that day! The atmosphere was awesome, the people who participated were fired up and excited, the coaches were nice! Just so good, so fun!

**On the first throwdown I had to do 3 things I had never done before, like AT ALL**. Talk about taking you out of your comfort zone! The event was something like this:

- 1km echo bike
- ?? meters sled hand over hand rope pull
- 800m assault runner run
- 1km echo bike

And at that point in my CrossFit "career" I had never touched the echo bike, the assault runner or even the sled rope pulls to be honest. I was confident with the sled pull, they showed us the technique, I thought, ok, I'm sure I'll do fine with that one, nice and easy, scale accordingly and do it, no problem. Assault runner, no idea what to expect, but I know it's demanding, but if I pace it, it's gonna be fine, no big deal, and I'm curious to see how it is. But the big question mark and concern for me was the assault runner - mostly I was thinking to myself, how the heck do I not fall off of that thing and make myself a fool, since I have no idea how to do it, what to expect. I remember even telling the coach and asking him if there was like anything special about it, or some strategy I'm unaware of or any tips, as I hadn't done it before. I don't remember his exact answer, or was he telling me to potentially scale with something else, I do not recall. But, the work out started, I moved through the paces, I think I did very decently on the echo bike both times, I did well on the sled pull, in fact, I could have had a bit more weight on it, but it is what it is, it was fun anyway. Finally the run came up and ... I did fine. The coach did give me some tips on how to lean forward etc., and I was able to do it, it felt a bit weird, given it was the first time I ever did it, especially getting off of the thing was funky, but I did fine, I ran decently, and most importantly, I did not fall 😅 Good. I finished top 4 of people, so I'm happy I kept a decent pace of the rest, and I'm happy I had fun with it and did some entirely new things, I had never done before. So cool!

The 2nd Throwdown involved team work and I partner with this nice girl called Laura. We did pretty good overall, she was definitely more fit than me, so I did my best not to slow her down too much.
That event included some amount of:

- Ski erg for 1 partner and rowing for the other partner
- DB snatches with 1 heavier weight and 1 lighter weight (I think it was 22.5kg and 15kg)
- Alternating box jumps on a pretty high box (we were both good at this though, so that was extra nice)

That was a super fun event to do together!
I also ordered a throwdown t-shirt but they never had them their to be picked up and eventually they said they would ship them to participants, but later on we got refunded and never got those t-shirts. Oh well, what can you do 😀

**I think for me personally watching to competition live and participating in the throwdowns was the absolute highlight of this 4-5 day trip. Specifically also trying out new things in the throwdowns!**.

But there were other noteworthy mentions, like visiting a local CrossFit box called CrossFit Werk, that was very nice! Did some bar muscle ups, double unders and actually my rope snapped lol, some light runs, and something they called "man makers", which was basically like a devils press + a thruster all in one. Challenging and a good workout, fun!
We also had a nice evening out with a buddy of mine - Matt, that was a lot of fun with plenty of interesting chatter about all sorts of life topics, very enjoyable!

#### 🇪🇸 Trip to Spain

I enjoyed the trip to Spain, but I had very mixed feelings about it. Because it was during the summer vacation, it was of course on a week I didn't have my son over, and before our vacation together the week after, so although the trip was enjoyable, there was a lot of thoughts in my mind going back to Anton and even thinking to myself he would have loved it there. There seemed to be a very nice entertaining program for kids in the evenings in my hotel, and I couldn't help but wish "what if Anton was here, her would have so much fun". For better or worse, those thoughts were pretty dominant. In the end, I'm "happy" I miss my son so much, means we have a solid bond and we have a lot of nice fun adventures together. But it felt pretty heavy at times, pretty sad.

Otherwise, the trip was nice and smooth. I met a girl called Judie in the plane and we chatted the whole way, she was cool. I had a taxi pre-booked to my hotel, which was a pretty long trip, so I offered her if she wanted to tag along and we drop her off at the stop she was to meet her friend, I think it worked out well for her, instead of having to figure out how to get there. At the same time it was on the way for us, so all good and the taxi driver didn't seem to mind. Many taxi drivers, as it turns out - zip English, like, nada. Oh well.

I enjoyed some Spanish music from the first taxi ride already. Had to shazaam some song, cause it was so good. The vibes were vibing, the music was great, I love listening to Spanish in general, I really like the language. Probably my second favorite after English. I had to learn to say "grathias" instead of how a mexican would say gracias for example, which I was more used to because of my time in the south western USA.

The hotel was nice all in all, pretty cozy, except for the night with the giant gecko incident 😀 Which was no big deal, but they moved me in another room, cause there was a gecko in mine and they couldn't find / catch and remove it. Haha, no big deal, just a funny one though. The pool at the hotel was awesome, really nice for swimming nice, long laps around, lounge around in the sun getting tanned. Of course, sun screen was a thing this time around and it was plenty warm as you can imagine of Spain in the end of July. Amazing, I loved it.

Of course, nothing beats the sea! It was so nice on the beach, I really enjoyed it. The sun, the sand, the sea water, absolutely amazing! Got an umbrella though, cause sun was defo shinning, but it was very pleasant. The funny thing was, what surprised me, that the current of the sea was so strong in that place in Alicante. You get in, and if you just float, it always dragged you down the coast pretty strongly. Interesting, hadn't experienced such a strong current so far from all the other places I had been to. **Another "funny" thing was that I lost my swimming goggles in the sea. Twice!**. Ai, ai, ai. You'd think I'd have learnt my lesson after the first time, but yeah, took me by surprise both times. Was just having some fun in the waves, and for a moment put my goggles up on my head - rookie mistake. Wave slammed me, goggles - gone. Same thing the next time a couple of days later, I felt so silly lol, I decided to not buy a third pair for the rest of the trip, as I indeed felt so silly. Not my strongest moment.

All in all if there's one word to describe how I feel about this past year, it's the word **FUN**. There are always some ups and downs in life, but overall, I'd like to leave you with this thought:

> **Focus on son, be present, be there, smile and joke, so that if I was to go tomorrow, I'd go being happy of how things have been**

To an amazing 2024!
