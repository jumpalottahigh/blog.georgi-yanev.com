It's been almost a bit scary writing in these yearly posts how much the current year has been better than the previous one for the past few years. And especially so when the previous year had been so, so good itself. So, I'm "happy" to say in its own weird way to report that won't be the case this year. Not because this year was not great. It was an absolutely amazing year, I'm very happy with it, there were quite a lot of great moments and a bunch of really cool experiences, progress in various ways... Yet this year brought also a lot of challenges, perhaps a bit more so than the past two. Some stress and other less positive vibes were a part of the picture too, perhaps a level slightly above average. Of course, all of this is through my very own, very personal, very subjective prism (attempting to be objective on the look out of the whole past year from the position of the last month of the year is a bit tricky 😅). Let's remember not to take all of this way too seriously; in the end it's all about having fun, having some thoughts laid out, some light and hopefully somewhat entertaining reflection. I should say, much like in all previous cases, I'm of course very grateful to be here, enjoying yet another lap around the sun, all the adventures had and thankful even for the tough times, cause we all know they trully mold us to be who we need to become.

Here's a picture gallery to kick this off and set the mood:

These posts started close to 10 years ago now with these simple goal setting lists. I'm not sure this is entire applicable nowadays. Especially with me mentality shift of **"Journey > Destination"**. But, like, fr fr. Six. Seven. (let's mimic the slang of gen Alpha a bit :D). Seriously though, let's look at the list:

I didn't do much for my book this year; yet, I'll keep that item on the list for next year too. I'm getting closer and closer to getting back to it I think. I've mentioned many times I like the setting and the plot of it, I still believe in it, years after I came up with the original premise for it, and that is a very good sign. I did play around with generating some AI images based on texts from my book to help with visualizing the main ideas of it, in fact, perhaps I should drop a couple below just to give you an idea.

I've not done Ironman training and I might do but it won't be for now a part of a list. If I decide to go for it, I will. I still like swimming, I'm still gonna work a bit on running, biking being the bigger bottleneck, but who knows, I might get into it. For now, it's not a big priority for me 😉 Same for the half marathon thing. It's really 100% a thing of "**why not be a person who's finished one, as opposed to a person who's not**". But sometimes, that's not enough of a reason to go for it. And again, who knows; stranger things have happened before, I might still go for it if the moment is right and I feel it. These posts and lists are not intended to completely plan out my life. In fact, I'd like to leave quite a lot of room for random stuff 😀.

CrossFit Open and Murph both went well, but more on that in the CrossFit section below. I've still not participated in a CrossFit comp, but I think I really want to give it a crack.

Let's see, before I even check my notes, from the top of my head, what's been the biggest news in my CrossFit journey this year? The first thing that comes to mind is the first body weight snatch I did in February <3. This is absolutely huge for me and been one of my biggest goals for the past 2 years. I was beyond stoked to do that 78kg snatch (BW: 76kg at the time). And then an 80kg power snatch 2 months later in April. So, so happy about this!
I did do the CrossFit Open and I think I was semi-pleased with my results, however, it's worth noting I had a strep throat and was on antibiotics for a week, which affected my performance for sure, but I'm still happy I was feeling well enough to show up and do it, and of course, Anton was my number one supporter <3.

Some stats as of December 2025:
