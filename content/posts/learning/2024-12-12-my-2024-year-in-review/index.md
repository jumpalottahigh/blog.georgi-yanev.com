### <span id="overview" class="offset-top-nav">"Heart and soul filling adventure called life!"</span>

The older I get and the more I keep writing these posts each year, the more I put emphasize on happiness, fun, smiling, "filling your soul" with experiences. I'm pretty sure, years ago the first few of those posts had a heavy focus on skills. What skills were improved this past year. Now it's more about what is the most memorable thing that happened to you this past year. Which person made an impression on you. Did you make an impression on someone? How did you spend time with your son? Did you have fun?

The past few years have genuinely been getting better and better, and I remember clearly thinking to myself in the beginning of this year:

> "I sure hope 2024 will be amazing, and there are already a few things to look forward to, but there's no way in hell it could be better than 2023. 2023 was pretty freaking awesome!"

Well, I'm happy to report 2024 knocked it out of the park and it was indeed an absolutely amazing year and I'm so grateful for it! Hard to imagine, and I hope 2025 follows the same trend.

One theme there wasn't really a dedicated chapter on above is people and relationships. And although I like being as transparent as I possibly can be in these posts, it feels a bit awkward to write about other people. To name them one by one and risk missing someone out. I will only say, that without these people many of the other things would hold no meaning. I love being a part of every community I'm a part of and I'm really grateful to be able to share stories, chat and laugh with those people. All of you! Thank you, I appreciate you a lot!

All in all, if there's one word to describe how I feel about this past year, it's the word **FUN**. There are always some ups and downs in life, but overall, I'd like to finish this with this thought:

> **Focus on myself, focus on my son, be present, be there really in the moment, smile and joke, so that if I was to go tomorrow, I'd go being happy of how things have been.**

Enjoy this beautiful adventure called life and remember to be kind to yourself! To an amazing 2024!
