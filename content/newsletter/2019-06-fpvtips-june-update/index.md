Hi,

Everyone and thanks for subscribing! I really appreciate it. Here's the latest scoop for June.

ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ Announcement ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
I started a brand new YouTube channel, called FPVTIPS.
The mission and the goal is to do much of the same I do with my blog - help people get into and enjoy FPV racing drones :) I will be doing builds, reviews, tips and other videos. Let me know if you have any requests or suggestions via email: georgiyanev.gy@gmail.com or on twitter @fpvtips.

I have only uploaded 2 videos so far, but would absolutely appreciate you checking them out, leaving some feedback in the comments and subscribing if interested :)

In other news, I will soon be reviewing a 5 inch BNF quad on blog.georgi-yanev.com and I'm very excited, because it strikes a great middle ground between price and performance, so stay tuned.

Finally, I keep on publishing my single pack, unedited flights on my Georgi FPV channel. Have a look and share your footage. And speaking of sharing, www.fpvtips.com now supports sharing the spots you create on the map. I'm very happy I built that functionality. It works like this:
https://www.fpvtips.com/fpv-map/?id=49a8c6b2-52d3-53a7-9a38-60e525cdab98

then you can browse the videos or pictures of the spot. Do share your flying spots with all of us! It's easy, takes 30 seconds to submit a spot :)

Again, thanks for subscribing, thanks for reading this and enjoy the skies! Happy flying!

Georgi
