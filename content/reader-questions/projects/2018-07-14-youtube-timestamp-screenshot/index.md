#### Reader questions:

**"This is a great little project! Thank you so much for putting it together! Quick question-- when I use your app to fetch a screenshot of a YouTube video at a specific timestamp, I'm unfortunately getting a banner ad at the bottom of the video (bc Puppeteer is running on Heroku w/o an adblocker, clearly). How did you get around this?"** - Robert

> Thank you! If I recall correctly I haven't done anything special about this, the implementation is pretty simple and using things out of the box, check the code here - https://github.com/jumpalottahigh/youtube-timestamp-screenshot - Georgi

**"Please also accept the short form YouTube links with time for example: [https://youtu.be/Yb-OYmHVchQ?t=15]() Because when you right click on a video to get the time stamped link that's what you get."** - Dashakol

> Hi, Dashakol and thanks for your suggestion! The project is open source and I would gladly accept PRs if you are willing to put one together. I loved building and learning from this project, but I haven't had more time to fully develop it further and there surely are a lot of missing features. However, the project is open source and available on GitHub so anyone can add more functionality to it, or just fork it and create their own. - Georgi
