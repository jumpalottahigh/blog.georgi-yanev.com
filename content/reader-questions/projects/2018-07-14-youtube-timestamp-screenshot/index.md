**"Please also accept the short form YouTube links with time for example: [https://youtu.be/Yb-OYmHVchQ?t=15]() Because when you right click on a video to get the time stamped link that's what you get."** - Dashakol

Hi, Dashakol and thanks for your suggestion! The project is open source and I would gladly accept PRs if you are willing to put one together. I loved building and learning from this project, but I haven't had more time to fully develop it further and there surely are a lot of missing features. However, the project is open source and available on GitHub so anyone can add more functionality to it, or just fork it and create their own. - Georgi
