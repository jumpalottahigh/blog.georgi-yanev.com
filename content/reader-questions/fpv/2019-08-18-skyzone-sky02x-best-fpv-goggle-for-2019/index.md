#### Reader Q & A:

**"How do I switch on the HDMI screen after I plug in the HDMI cords? All I am getting is the forward camera on my SkyZone 02X goggles"** - Butch

Press and hold the modes button. - Georgi

**"could you list a battery to purchase with the other extra's you have"** - Sealcomm :)

I use the long power cord and an old 3S battery. Any 2S - 6S battery would do. If you would like something with a short power cord to just put on the side of the goggle strap, you can get this [Eachine battery](https://bit.ly/eachine-2s-goggle-battery) or this [Fatshark battery](https://bit.ly/fatshark-goggle-battery), both would work nicely.
