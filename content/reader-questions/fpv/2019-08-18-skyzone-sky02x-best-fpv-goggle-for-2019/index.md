**"could you list a battery to purchase with the other extra's you have"** - Sealcomm :)

> I use the long power cord and an old 3S battery. Any 2S - 6S battery would do. If you would like something with a short power cord to just put on the side of the goggle strap, you can get this [Eachine battery](https://bit.ly/eachine-2s-goggle-battery) or this [Fatshark battery](https://bit.ly/fatshark-goggle-battery), both would work nicely. - Georgi
