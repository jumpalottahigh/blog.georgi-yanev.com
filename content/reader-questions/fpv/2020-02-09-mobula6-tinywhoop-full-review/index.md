#### Reader Q & A:

**"Can you please show me how i upgrade my Mobula6 to Betaflight 4.2?"** - itz_dxve

> Sure, it's a great suggestion, I'll post something as soon as I have it available - Georgi

**"Did you find that Jesc 48Khz and RPM filters made the throttle feel a bit "mushy"? Other than that it seems to fly better than before."** - Alex in Montana

> Hmm, I haven't felt anything like that, but personally I'm just not a fan of emuflight's yaw authoritive turns (which has nothing to do with jesc or filters, but I guess somewhat related 😅) - Georgi

\*\*\*

**"When you upgrade to Betaflight 4.1, do you change the PIDs or use the stock from the early version?"** - Annonymous

> I haven't upgraded it to BF 4.1. Mine was still running on the stock 3.5.7 (at least until I set up Emuflight on it). I would assume though that you would need to tweak the PIDs if moving to 4.1. Perhaps the Mobula 6 FB group is a good place to start searching for more resources - Georgi

**"Hi, I can see you have a great video feed flying indoors. What google are you using? What Vtx module do you have? What antennas do you use?"** - arield

> Hi, arield. My goggles are the [Skyzone 02X](https://bit.ly/skyzone-02x) goggles and here is the [full review](/fpv/skyzone-sky02x-best-fpv-goggles-for-2019/) you can check for more info. I really like them and have been using them for almost an year now. They have a built-in receiver.

> The vtx on the Mobula6 is an on-board built-in 25mW power output capable transmitter on the Crazybee F4FR Lite all in one board.

> For antennas I still mostly use Aomway and Realacc antennas, the exact ones are in [my gear article](/fpv/gear-2019/#goggles) - Georgi

**"Thanks for this guide! Did you have to enable bi-directional DSHOT in Betaflight after going to 4.1 and flashing JESC? Did you have to buy licenses for the ESCs for JESC? After doing what you did and enabling bi directional dshot I get “RPMFILTER” Warning in OSD when trying to arm."** - Pete

> Unless you want RPM filtering you don't need Betaflight 4.1 and you don't need a license for JESC. If you want also RPM filtering, then you do need to flash Betaflight 4.1 and you need to purchase a license for the JESC firmware. In my example I'm sticking to Betaflight 3.5.7, and when flashing the ESC, I only get the 48kHz update, not the one with RPM filtering as well. Hope this helps. - Georgi
