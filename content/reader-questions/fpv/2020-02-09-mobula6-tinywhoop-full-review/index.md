#### Reader Q & A:

**"Thanks for this guide! Did you have to enable bi-directional DSHOT in Betaflight after going to 4.1 and flashing JESC? Did you have to buy licenses for the ESCs for JESC? After doing what you did and enabling bi directional dshot I get “RPMFILTER” Warning in OSD when trying to arm."** - Pete

> Unless you want RPM filtering you don't need Betaflight 4.1 and you don't need a license for JESC. If you want also RPM filtering, then you do need to flash Betaflight 4.1 and you need to purchase a license for the JESC firmware. In my example I'm sticking to Betaflight 3.5.7, and when flashing the ESC, I only get the 48kHz update, not the one with RPM filtering as well. Hope this helps. - Georgi
