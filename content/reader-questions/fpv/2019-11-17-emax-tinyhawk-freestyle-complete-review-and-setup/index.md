#### Reader Q & A:

**"Awesome article! Could you elaborate on the differences with the GepRC Phantom? You say they are very different, but in what way? If you put the Avon Rush props on the Phantom and use the same battery, I'd imagine they would fly quite similarly?"** - L0stB1t

Thanks so much, glad you liked it! This is an awesome question and at the same time so so hard to answer shortly, so here goes. I legit LOVE flying both of these drones, but indeed they are quite different. For example, I have a full range XM+ receiver on the GepRC Phantom and that [allows me to go way further out](https://youtu.be/nYK-tmc42m0?t=29) past the few hundred meters the Tinyhawk can do. On the other hand, I only just ordered bigger batteries, but so far with me 2S 350mah I get much smaller flight times on the Phantom. The cameras on both quads are quite similar, but I think I prefer the camera on the GepRC Phantom slightly more in terms of colors, but the Phantom's camera has every once in a while a weird warped line going across slightly above the center of the image for a couple of seconds.

The Tinyhawk Freestyle blows my mind with its flight time on 2 x 1S 450mah GNB batteries. Easily 5 minutes. And although I fly both of them on the same Rush props, you can really feel that the Tinyhawk Freestyle is SO MUCH lighter and in many cases [it _feels_ as if it flies faster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFk7SJso9iQ&list=PLt8_2AobQjAdaL2fUZM8zd6xzNZdMt0nz&index=17). It's also just a bit more locked in and handles turns even easier. Plus let's me get my moneys worth out of those nice 1S GNBs I have stacked up.

**If I'm honest I gave up on trying to choose the better one - I think they fit different scenarios**. That's why I always suggest to everyone to consider their use case. If you have a lot of those 1S batteries dangling around; do you fly close within yourself in parks or would you rather go a bit further out; how important is HD video to you, etc. The only thing I would like is HD video from those craft but of course the extra weight would impact the flight characterestics a bit. - Georgi
