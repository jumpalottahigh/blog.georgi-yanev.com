#### Reader Q & A:

**"Hi, do you have eu version of the frsky radio?"** - Libor

> I'm currently using FCC, I have used LBT (eu) previously too. Perhaps this can help with [some information on how to switch](/fpv/set-up-taranis-x-lite-update-opentx/#update) if you need to.

**"Nice tuto m8... But I have a question. How can I change the auto start recording camera to no start as soon you connect the battery? Thank you in advance."** - Rod

> Try changing the `Start Action` in the camera app. Failing that, check the camera documentation if you could do that with the physical buttons on it (maybe by pressing and holding the power button?). - Georgi

**"I found how to change the auto start recording :) but now I have another question. How you change the VTx power? Thanks again."** - Rod

> You can do that via the OSD by going full yaw left and pitch up to display the menu. - Georgi

**"I have same problem with latest video on sd card. It says corrupted video. Let me know if you find out why that is. Great article. Thanks, Chris"**

> From all the googling and testing I did, it seems to be a "by design feature". I don't like it but it is what it is. To make sure your last flight always gets correctly saved, when done flying, **unplug the battery and plug it back in for a few seconds**. This should give the camera enough time to write the video file correctly to the SD card. Again, I don't like it, but I can confirm it works reliably. - Georgi

**"Thank yo for this review and set up guide Georgi! This guide and video has helped me very much, however, I can not get my LED's on the tail end to light up. I've used your CLI you've linked to but they still won't illuminate. I have the F7 FC (advanced version). I'm very new at this and still learning so any information would be very helpful. Thanks"**

> I'm also using the advanced version and my tail LEDs are just blinking by default. If yours don't light up at all, I'd check the wiring and have a look at the `LED strip` tab in Betaflight. Maybe something is disabled there? Good luck! - Georgi
