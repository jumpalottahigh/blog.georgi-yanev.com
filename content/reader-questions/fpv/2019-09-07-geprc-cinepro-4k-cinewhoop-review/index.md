#### Reader Q & A:

**"Nice tuto m8... But I have a question. How can I change the auto start recording camera to no start as soon you connect the battery? Thank you in advance."** - Rod

Try changing the `Start Action` in the camera app. Failing that, check the camera documentation if you could do that with the physical buttons on it (maybe by pressing and holding the power button?). - Georgi

**"I found how to change the auto start recording :) but now I have another question. How you change the VTx power? Thanks again."** - Rod

You can do that via the OSD by going full yaw left and pitch up to display the menu. - Georgi

**"I have same problem with latest video on sd card. It says corrupted video. Let me know if you find out why that is. Great article. Thanks, Chris"**

From all the googling and testing I did, it seems to be a "by design feature". I don't like it but it is what it is. To make sure your last flight always gets correctly saved, when done flying, **unplug the battery and plug it back in for a few seconds**. This should give the camera enough time to write the video file correctly to the SD card. Again, I don't like it, but I can confirm it works reliably. - Georgi
