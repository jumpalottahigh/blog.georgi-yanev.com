#### Reader questions:

**"Hello ! Do you know where to soder the "audio" cable if you bought a vtx with one ? Thanks !"** - Dominic

> I guess that would depend on which VTX and what FC / AiO board you're using, so check for official product documentation or pinout diagrams - Georgi

\*\*\*

**"Hi, I have the VR-007 goggles and I am looking at putting this VTX on my wizard. What kind of antenna should I get for my goggles?"** - Annonymous

> Get a good omnidirectional antenna. That's the best option since those goggles lack a diversity module. Some antennas I use can be seen on [my gear page](/fpv/gear-2019/#goggles) - Georgi
