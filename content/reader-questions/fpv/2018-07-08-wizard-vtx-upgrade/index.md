#### Reader Q & A:

**"Hello ! Do you know where to soder the "audio" cable if you bought a vtx with one ? Thanks !"** - Dominic

> Unfortunately I cannot help you with that from the top of my head, as I've never done anything with audio previously. In my head it's always been like a really cool idea, but not really necessary for what I do. Good idea to look into in the future though. Additionally my wizard is probably pretty dated by now, I got it about 3 years ago and I'm sure the newer versions have newer flight controllers and are perhaps set up a bit differently. Good luck with the setup and sorry I wasn't able to help out with this one. - Georgi

**"Hi, I have the VR-007 goggles and I am looking at putting this VTX on my wizard. What kind of antenna should I get for my goggles?"** - Annonymous

> Get a good omnidirectional antenna. That's the best option since those goggles lack a diversity module. Some antennas I use can be seen on [my gear page](/fpv/gear-2019/#goggles) - Georgi
