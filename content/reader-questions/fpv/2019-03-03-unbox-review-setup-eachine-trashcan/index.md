**"Hi, I'm Sam please help me bind my trashcan to flysky, the bind button is not working ,no light is flashing at the back when I press the botton, I pressed hard on it and black part came off from the bind botton ?"** - Sam

You can bind the drone from the Betaflight CLI without having to press the bind button. Open Betaflight, go to the CLI tab and type: `bind_rx`. If thisÂ doesn't work, type `bind_rx_spi`. They changed the command in newer 4.0.x Betaflight versions. - Georgi
