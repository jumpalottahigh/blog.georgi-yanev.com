#### Reader Q & A:

**"Great Review. Thank you. But How is the Air Unit attached to the Topplate? Double-sided adhesive tape?"**

> Thanks a lot, glad you liked it! The Holybro Kopis2 HDV comes with a couple of small double sided sticky tape strips pre-isntalled on the bottom part of its top plate. I would say that mounting it so is pretty reliable and didn't come off even in a crash :)

**"'ðŸŽ¦ Setting up the DJI digital FPV system with the Holybro Kopis2 HDV Coming soon' Looking forward to this please"** - anon

> Thank you for your interest, been a bit busy at work, but working on this and ðŸ¤ž hoping to get it out this weekend :)

**"Did you get the DJI FPV system? I'm trying to do the same modification on my drone but it came with the RunCam attached. I'm not sure how two switch the two systems."** - Ohern1

> Yes! I finally did, literally yesterday - May 8th 2020. It's been quite a while, I ordered it about 2 months ago, but at least very happy it's finally here and I'm planning on testing it and updating this article as soon as possible.

> You can check back in a week or so. Or, another way to stay tuned for the updates is to subscribe to [FPVtips on YouTube](https://fpvtips.com/youtube) and stay tuned for the second video in the DJI digital FPV series. Happy flying! - Georgi
