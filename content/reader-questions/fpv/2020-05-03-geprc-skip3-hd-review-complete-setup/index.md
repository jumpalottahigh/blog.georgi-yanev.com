#### Reader Q & A:

**"I've just got this drone and having a bit of trouble binding it - for some reason the xm+ receiver is the other way round with the f/s button towards the front. I'm using the X-lite pro but am getting no solid green light."** - Drone-noob

> The steps mentioned in this article should work for you too, unless you have some mismatching firmware issues. Make sure that both your radio and the FrSky XM+ receiver run the same firmware (either FCC or LBT).
