**"Hello. If I buy this drone, what receiver do you recommend? I need big screen, and I am new..."** - Offer

That would depend on what radio you have. You can't go wrong with a FrSky receiver (XM+), as it's light weight, but full range and has basic signal strength reporting (RSSI) which you could see in your goggles. Welcome to the hobby! If you also need a screen (I assume goggles, since after all we are talking about flying FPV), you could go for a cheaper pair of box goggles at first and then grab a good pair of Skyzones, Fatsharks, Orqas depending on how much you are willing to spend. Or maybe skip analog and go DJI digital FPV system from the get go. There are many options and it's a great time to join the hobby! - Georgi
