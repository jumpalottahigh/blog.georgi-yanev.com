#### Reader Q & A:

**"What goggles for HD? I have fatshark HDO2, will that work for HD? Love vids!"** - Steve Denton

> The only digital goggles on the market are the DJI goggles at the moment. This quad's HD camera only records on board video and does not transmit it. You could build a similar (perhaps slightly heavier and bigger) quad that has a Caddx Vista camera on board and is therefor compatible with the DJI FPV system. That's I guess one way to handle HD if you really want that. - Georgi

**"hello there, 1stly I would like to say thanks for all of your articles. it give me an idea how to start with this hobby. and my question, can it fly slowly and stable at home ? any another option for the quad in 2020 ?"** - ardian

> If you have the skills (and a bigger house :)) you can make the Mobula7 HD work indoors as well (or with some throttle limiting). However if indoors is your main focus, I strongly recommend looking into the [Mobula6](/fpv/mobula6-48khz-jesc-complete-setup-review/) or [Mobula6HD](https://bit.ly/mobula6-hd) instead. Great little crafts you can fly indoors and have tons of fun. - Georgi

**"recommand PID tune, its unstable during a (building)dive"** - Annonymous

> I'm not sure you can do enough with just PID tuning to improve prop wash on building dives. As much as I love the Mobula7 HD, I'm not convinced it's the right tool to the tall building dives. Either way, check out Project Mockingbird for optimal configuration. - Georgi

**"Is the 75% throttle only throttle rate? Or do I need to do 75% on the others as well?"** - Joe

> Follow the instructions in the **Throttle limits** section in [the Eachine Trashcan article](/fpv/unbox-review-setup-eachine-trashcan/#throttle-limits). - Georgi

**"How to charge IT? Plase Anwser me"** - Annonymous

> That would depend on the batteries you use, but if you use something similar to what I recommend, with standard balance connectors, [these battery chargers](/fpv/gear-2019/#chargers) will work just fine for you. - Georgi

**"How do you switch the vtx from 25 to 200mw? I agree with everything you wrote. Its a stellar cinewhoop! (One of my motors just failed, though... :( )"** - RobinK

> When you plug in your quad go `yaw left` + `pitch up` to enter the OSD, then go into `Features` => `VTX`. Find `power` and adjust the value, then remember to save on the way out. Happy you enjoy your Mobula, I had a [motor fail too and got it replaced](/fpv/how-to-change-mobula7-hd-motor/) real quick. - Georgi
