#### Reader Q & A:

**"recommand PID tune, its unstable during a (building)dive"** - Annonymous

I'm not sure you can do enough with just PID tuning to improve prop wash on building dives. As much as I love the Mobula7 HD, I'm not convinced it's the right tool to the tall building dives. Either way, check out Project Mockingbird for optimal configuration. - Georgi

**"Is the 75% throttle only throttle rate? Or do I need to do 75% on the others as well?"** - Joe

Follow the instructions in the **Throttle limits** section in [the Eachine Trashcan article](/fpv/unbox-review-setup-eachine-trashcan/#throttle-limits). - Georgi

**"How to charge IT? Plase Anwser me"** - Annonymous

That would depend on the batteries you use, but if you use something similar to what I recommend, with standard balance connectors, [these battery chargers](/fpv/gear-2019/#chargers) will work just fine for you. - Georgi
