#### Reader Q & A:

**"How can I remote the Run Cam 5 Orange via usb and micro switch."** - Horni

> I'm not sure what do you mean by "micro switch". The only ways (I know of) of accessing the cam's settings is by adjusting the settings file manually or by using the phone app and reading the QR code from it. - Georgi

**"Can you please add information on glass replacements? I am told you can, but I would be curious how and where this would be purchased."** - Scott Woeber

> You can [grab a replacement glass for the RunCam 5](https://shop.runcam.com/tempered-glass-protector-for-runcam-5/) from the official RunCam site. - Georgi

**"Video out connection? What is the USB pinout for that?"** - Michael

> I have no idea, I've never opened up my RunCam5 to try and mess with the internals. Chances are you can find some pinout if you google for it and search for images. Good luck! - Georgi
