This project is [open source](https://github.com/jumpalottahigh/blog.georgi-yanev.com) and you can use it for inspiration and playing around as much as you like. In fact, **I have created a [Gatsby theme](https://github.com/jumpalottahigh/gatsby-theme-jumpalottahigh-blog) that you can use much easier**, by just installing it as a dependency in your Gatsby project. Or fork and work with it, as it does not include any of the copywrited content and will save you hours of removing the irrelevant to you parts.

The **article copy is copywrited and if you'd like to use a segment or quote the author, a written permission is required**, in which case, you can contact me in a number of ways, including Twitter, YouTube, etc., so check out the [about page for more details](/about/).

Publishing the entire site as is is also a copyright infrindgement.
