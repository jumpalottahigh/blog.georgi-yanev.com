This is a living document and an ongoing project. More pictures and information will come as I progress with the build. This build is heavily inspired by [UAVfutures' 110MPH build][1] with some changes.

### Dry assembly

As some of the parts arrived I decided to do a "dry" assembly of the frame to have a look at components and potential pitfalls and I did indeed find one. The screws that came with the [BrotherHobby Returner motors][2] were too short for the thick 6mm arms of the [Realacc Furious frame][3]. Luckily I had also ordered an assortment of screws and hope to find a fitting match there.

I guess the soldering and motor mounting will have to wait until the correct length screws arrive.
