This is a living document and an ongoing project. More pictures and information will come as I progress with the build. This build is heavily inspired by [UAVfutures' 110MPH build][1] with some changes.

### Initial test assembly

As some of the parts arrived I decided to do an initial test assembly of the frame to have a look at components and potential pitfalls and I did indeed find one. The screws that came with the [BrotherHobby Returner motors][2] were too short for the thick 6mm arms of the [Realacc Furious frame][3]. Luckily I had also ordered an assortment of screws and hope to find a fitting match there.

### Mount the motors

It seemed that 10mm was the perfect length screw I needed to get through the frame arm and just enough into the motor. Additionally I used some loctite threadlocker and tightened the screws properly. Here's the frame with the motors mounted.
