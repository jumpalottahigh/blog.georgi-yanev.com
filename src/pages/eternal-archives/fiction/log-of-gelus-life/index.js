        [LOG: 1] "Today is the big day" -- think you standing in front of the
        great woods of the west. Finally today we finished our journey. The ship
        lies at anchor in that small but beautiful bay. I shall leave my men to
        take care of the ship while I do something here. The bad thing about it
        is that much money is required, probably I'll even have to sell my
        quality goods. Whatever, money isn't needed now. First I need to seek
        for the old witch who saved my beloved village when I was a little kid.
        May be she can tell me more about my future. I really can't stand it
        anymore! All this work, which queen Catherine wants me to do. "Gelu, do
        that, do that, blah, blah, blah" -- she says, but I just want to rest
        and live peacefully in my village. I know this is imposible ... for now,
        but anyway. Let's see, everything comes with the time. Finishing your
        thoughts you turn back, look at the glorious ship of the good, and then
        proceed to the darkened forest ahead.
        <br />
        <br />
        [LOG: 2.1] I am the green forest guard. I will let you pass only if you
        prove your courage and boldness to be great hero. I know you Gelu, but
        you do not. I was one of your protectors, when you were a little chaild.
        However, I need to know if you are ready for the great tasks ahead. Go
        visit Miruanda now.
        <br />
        <br />
        [LOG: 2.2] Still nothing? Go now! You met Miruanda, didn't you? She will
        tell you where to prove you worth the time spent on you. Go, listen to
        the old witch, for she knows much more than even me.
        <br />
        <br />
        [LOG: 2.3] Finally my chaild. You may proceed now. Go get on your ship
        and leave this forsaken land. The witch told you what to do, right? Ok,
        go and may the spirits watch over you. Good luck.
        <br />
        <br />
        [LOG: 3] Thinking again you remember that that same witch, who you must
        seek was living far to the north from the place you are. Perhaps you
        shouldn't go to the woods to the west first! Yes, that's it! I'm going
        to the witch, inspired by this final blow of thoughts you go on through
        that small forest you are at.
        <br />
        <br />
        [LOG: 4] "Stop!" -- you hear silence, old voice apparently of a woman.
        Standing still you think what is going on, while you hear the voice
        again. "Defeat us, and prove you are the one". You still don't know what
        is going on but confident in your power you proceed to discover a huge
        garrison made up of wood. Then you recognize some wood elves and centaur
        captains who preapre for battle. You now know what is happening.
        Shouting soundly you rush a head to the small battlefield.
        <br />
        <br />
        [LOG: 5] Walking forward you see old hut. You are just thinking to leave
        this place when realize there is somebody behind you. You turn and see
        the old witch you've heard so much about. "I've been told to find you"
        -- you say. "Yes, I know" -- she replies coldly -- "tell me why are you
        here". "I was going to the great woods when a guard told me that he
        won't let me pass if I don't bring him 30 wood elves and 100 centaur
        captains". "We have these warriors in the village but probably you don't
        have any gold to buy them". "Yes, all the gold and other goodies I had
        were used to pay my sailors and to repair the ship". "If you help me
        find four-leaved clover I will give you the money required. You can go
        to my hut and see through the magic orb I have. Perhaps it will show you
        where to search. Go now!". Before you are able to ask anymore questions
        the old witch disappears in the wind. Looks like you got no options
        except to go find that four-leaved clover and give it to the witch. At
        that moment you ask yourself where will you find her to give her the
        clover? Suddenly the air fills with white clouds, which write in the
        sky: "Find me in the old tree near my hut". Well, now the last thing was
        specified. You take your hat, and run in the far south to take the
        clover.
        <br />
        <br />
        [LOG: 6] Wow! It's full of four-leaved clovers here. You will just
        crouch and take one... "Hey, who is messing with our clovers?" -- a
        group of sprites is preparing to fight you, but it seems like you don't
        care. After all they are only some weak creatures. If you have to, you
        wil take the little clover by fight!
        <br />
        <br />
        [LOG: 7] You see this small village and wonder if it can provide you
        with your needed 100 centaur captains and 30 wood elves. Walking forward
        you now realize there are much more units here than 100 centaurs and 30
        elves. Having your precious units you turn back with the new centaurs
        and elves to the great woods to give the guard what he needs.
        <br />
        <br />
        [LOG: 8] Walking through the great woods is a great danger too these
        days. You know that from your elders. You were just thinking over these
        words when suddenly a group of rogues and thiefs comes from the near
        trees. It looks like they want you dead and robbed. It's up to you now.
        <br />
        <br />
        [LOG: 9] Having defeated the rouges your spirit rises and the whole
        group and you too, begin to feel a bit more lucky.
        <br />
        <br />
        [LOG: 10] I'm the Devil of Brimstone...
        <br />
        <br />
        [LOG: 11] I'm the Devil of Hellfire...
        <br />
        <br />
        [LOG: 12] I'm the Arch-Devil of the Light Power... may I join you?
        <br />
        <br />
        [LOG: 13] Wow! All these mages are afraid of the mummies? Why should I
        do it? Should I make it? Questions appear in your head. Not so convinced
        you proceed forward.
        <br />
        <br />
        [LOG: 14] You can see the mummies that stole the artifacts from the
        paladin. They are sleeping but ... unlucky you! One of the sharshooters
        steps on a dry stick and the sound wakes the mummies up. You feel bad.
        <br />
        <br />
        [LOG: 15] Who dares disturb us. Curse you!
        <br />
        <br />
        [LOG: 16] You have the courage!
        <br />
        <br />
        [LOG: 17] You have the valor!
        <br />
        <br />
        [LOG: 18] The last thing that stands before you are these dwarfs. They
        are powerful enough to slay you along with your whole army, but you
        don't think about that now. You only think how to get out of this cursed
        island and continue on your journey.
        <br />
        <br />
        [LOG: 19] "Give us all your money, or we'll never let you pass to your
        ship" -- says the boss of the dwarves. "Oh, yeah! Take this money" --
        says one of your shapshooters and fires his arrow straight into the
        boss's eye. Burning with anger the dwarves attack!
