        Chapter 1 – The Very Beginning
        <br />
        <br />
        The small village tavern, called ‘The Rune Stone’, was settled in a
        small valley, between the great woods of the Silvermoon forest and the
        Darrowmere lake. The poor light of an old lamp could not be enough to
        lighten up the tavern’s main hall in this autumn night. The barkeeper
        looked worried, for there weren’t far too many customers this night.
        Only two main groups of people were symmetrically positioned in the
        opposite corners of the pub. They were laughing and joking with one
        another as the hours passed. Two friends, who looked like ordinary
        peasants, represented one of the groups. They talked, like everyone else
        did, about the recent day, passed in hard work.<br />
        In that same moment the door opened, waving the dry, passive air
        changing it into night’s cool breeze. Everyone felt the refreshing
        ‘wind’ and looked at the old wooden door. A short old man went inside
        and sat over the two peasants. They paid no attention to him, as he
        ordered some beer. He kept drinking ale after ale, and kept listening to
        the peasants. They, however, were so absorbed by their conversation,
        that they even spoke of the old prophecies and myths and at one point
        the old man even joined the conversation. Then the two friends spoke of
        the ancient days and the elves. There were many, many rumors that they
        spoke of. Some said that the elves still live in the mountains of
        Quel’thalas, but no one saw them after the second and last invasion of
        the Burning Legion. Some said that the elves joined their old brothers –
        the Night Elves, and went to Kalimdor. Others said that the elves were
        imprisoned in Northrend by the last band of trolls and orcs. Yet, none
        knew the truth.<br />
        “This all in not true” the old man said deeply and confident in his
        words.<br />
        “I can tell you the story of the High Elves.” the man said loudly.
        Everybody in the tavern turned towards him.<br />
        “Leave that old man. He’s drunk” the other group of townsman looked with
        sympathy at him, for they all knew that many of the old man and women
        nowadays were crazed by the treacherous wars with the Burning Legion,
        the Horde, and now the Undead. Many lost their families, but when those
        stupid necromancers came and rose the dead … the situation got even
        worse. No one liked his dead relative to walk undead and seed chaos over
        his own kind. So it was very difficult for the elder people to get
        accustomed to all those horrific events.<br />
        “Silence! I am the prophet, and no one will ever call me that way!” the
        figure of the ‘old man’ stand up and rose as his eyes filled with anger.{' '}
        <br />
        “I failed once, yes, it is truth. But I think I did enough to pay my
        mistakes” he sat and began his tale.<br />
        “Many centuries ago, about 10 000 years, the Dragons ruled Azeroth. West
        of here there was an enormously huge land called Kalimdor. It still
        exists nowadays, but the half of it has sunken into the Great Sea. So in
        that same land awakened the race of the Night Elves. There are no other
        elfish races different to the Night ones. The others emerged later. I
        was one of the first to be born. Our race was developing quickly and
        steadily for we all were immortal. There was no death for us. We could
        only be killed by foe, never by the fate. No matter our glorious
        development we began creating powerful magiks for different tasks. Then
        the magic became part of our everyday life. We used it for everything
        you could imagine – even to just pick an object up from a distance.
        Foolish me, it was I who first intended to use the elfish magiks for a
        more important things. Yet, I don’t quite remember now, but I can tell
        that magiks were everywhere. I hope you get the picture” the prophet
        interrupted his speech and bought everyone, who listened to him, a
        drink. He used this short break to relax and calm down a little.<br />
        “I invented magiks that enabled world travel. You see, truth is that all
        worlds are connected to the world of the dead souls – the Twisting
        Nether. By going into the Nether, and venturing deeper into the Great
        Dark Beyond, you are able to visit almost any place in the universe. I
        did so. I’ve been to Dreanor, too. A pity it has been destroyed, indeed.
        It was very beautiful red world, full of ‘strange’ (for our
        understandings) plants and animals. That is not the point of my tale,
        though. It was then, when the Daemon Lord Sargeras detected our powerful
        magic sources. So, the Burning Legion invaded. It took us about 1000
        years to fight for our land. Yet, the Dragons helped us and probably
        thanks to them we finally defeated Sargeras and his army. We pursued his
        army of fire stoned demons out of our world and far into the universe.
        Of course that was a battle won, but the war was still at hand and will
        always be. I understood later that those demons that we pursued
        corrupted our Orcish brothers from Draenor. This is why the war will
        never end. There will always be someone to corrupt the noble people,
        making them a grave danger indeed ” by his last sentence, the ‘old man’
        wide opened his eyes, showing their bright and dark side alike.<br />
        “I’m beginning to have second thoughts about that old man. He could be
        one of those crazed necromancers, do you think?” a farmer asked his
        wife. She didn’t say a word, though, still staring at the ‘prophet’.<br
        />
        “So my word was about Sargeras. We entomb him west of here, not so far
        from the shores of Sunken Kalimdor. No matter that ‘great’ success I was
        banned from my homeland and send into exile. The small group of the
        Night Elves that helped me design my invention, who have vowed not to
        use magic ever again (like me) came along with me. We chose Quel’thalas
        for it was the only free region except Northrend to inhabit. As we
        traveled towards that destination we were told of the awakening of the
        mortal races. Humans, dwarfs, gnomes, trolls and many, many others were
        the first we heard about during our 6-month journey”.<br />
        <br />
        Chapter 2 – The Shores of Northrend<br />
        <br />
        One day, probably 2 months after we last ‘saw’ the shores of Sunken
        Kalimdor, Hyjal shouted from the top of the front mast. Everyone trusted
        him, as I did for he was my very best friend, so we all looked at the
        far northeast. Those were some white-colored shores. It was strange, for
        we all had never seen such brightly colored land … or was that land?<br
        />
        “It’s weird! Our priestess of the Moon has never told us of this land.
        It is not shown on any map. But I guess our people need to rest a bit
        from rowing all day and night for the last months. What do you think?”
        Hyjal looked worried about what I was going to say, but his face kept
        its usual cheerful looking mood.<br />
        “You decide whether we proceed, or stop for a day or two. It looks like
        we’re the next of the history writers. We found a land that no one knew
        it even existed, we may do other more important things in the near
        future. Who knows?” I replied, smiling at my friend. I then left him
        tell our people the glorious news and went to my room, for I knew that
        the next day would be a difficult one. At least for me. I laid down on
        my bed and thought about the upcoming great exploration of that new
        land. Suddenly I remembered that we hadn’t chose its new name yet. “I
        guess I’ll let Hyjal think of something. Hyjal. That name again. My old
        friend was named after Kalimdor’s sacred mountain summit. That was the
        place we had lived for hundreds of years after my unsuccessful
        experiment, until they exiled me away from my very home. Nonsense! It’s
        all my fault and I will suffer the consequences. Tomorrow will be a
        great day.” With my last thought gone I fall asleep.<br />
        As the sun rose I woke up and went outside. It was just another
        beautiful sunny day and we all gathered around Hyjal to hear what should
        we do.<br />
        “We cannot allow a full three-days rest in this land for it is both
        unknown and we have to proceed with our journey. We can, however, spend
        a day or mostly two, while our druids write down maps of this island. It
        is not as much time as many of us would want, but I dare to say it’s
        enough. As a matter of fact we’ve got an important problem to solve
        ahead. We’ve got to find a place to live in.” Hyjal took a deep breath
        and continued his speech.<br />
        “I know that many of you ask yourselves if this isn’t just the right
        place to inhabit. Well, it could be but we don’t know a thing about it
        yet. Now let’s get in the boats and raw to the shore. You got about 12
        hours to rest, walk and do whatever you want. After that we’ll meet at
        the shore again to see what the druids can tell us about that land.
        Hurry up!” the crowd around Hyjal was growing larger as his speech
        progressed and now there were about two times more people than the time
        he started. Everyone looked happy and cheerful as if an elf in exile
        could be any joyful. “You truly are a confident person, my friend.” I
        thought about Hyjal and went forward to greet him.<br />
        “Did you sleep well?” my friend asked.<br />
        “You heard about the schedule, didn’t you?” he didn’t even waited to
        answer his first question and asked again. I saw impatience in Hyjal’s
        eyes. My friend looked eager to explore this land with every passing
        moment, so I decided not to waste his time now.<br />
        “So we got only a day? Well, I hope the druids don’t waste their time.
        See you later.” I turned around and went back to my room to take the
        rest of my equipment. “This cannot last any long.” I thought about our
        exile. “We have to find a place to live like normal elves. I don’t know
        where are we supposed to go. I will ask Hyjal later. But what if this is
        our new home? Or what if we go live with those newborn. With the Humans.
        I’d better be going or else those questions will be the very end of me.
        To every problem there is solution, every question has his own answer
        and every quest could be completed as our ancients say. Calm now!”
        thinking over all those topics I took my bag, some elfish food and ran
        away. I was the last one at the boats, so I quickly jumped towards one
        of the full ones and found a small place to sit down. I thought again
        about those new races. Our druid scouts report that there are not only
        new races, but the dragons had disappeared also. Strange.<br />
        “So you made it anyway!” Hyjal put his arm on my shoulder and smiled at
        me.<br />
        “I guess I did!” words are useless when two old friends understand each
        other.<br />
        “RAW” I heard from behind and prepared for the splendid view that we
        will probably encounter.<br />
        <br />
        Chapter 3 – The Foundation of Northrend<br />
        <br />
        When we finally landed on the shores of Northrend I felt weird. I was
        feeling that way for the very first time. The sun was high in the sky,
        but the air was still cold. The land was colored in white and was also
        cold. Nevertheless we were all happy, for we knew that we were going to
        discover a new land. A land unknown even to the old prophets like my
        self. As I thought about all those odd things we had saw this far, Hyjal
        lead us deeper inside a white forest.<br />
        “Even the trees are … different!” I could not hold my thought. Hyjal
        heard me.<br />
        “Strange are these lands and we still have no idea of what is waiting
        for us deeper into the tree labyrinth.” Hyjal sounded strange, but I
        even did not notice that in that great moment. The captain of the ship
        shouted in the same time.<br />
        “Hear me brothers! We shall settle a camp in this valley. You can use
        the time until the next sunrise as you wish. The Aran Food will be
        served after about 5 hours. Don’t be late or the spirits of the Nephalem
        will be angry.” Our most ancient ones – the Spirits of the Nephalem.
        They were named after the other great mountain summit – Nephalem.
        Tradition is that the Aran Food, or also Noble Food, should be served
        every three days at the sunset. That Food is represented mostly by
        Kalimdor bread by plants from the Hyjal foothills and fresh ice-cold
        water from the Nephalem summit’s highest lake. That same lake was where
        the Nephalem brothers saved our capital forest town from lord
        Auchinduin’s attacks. Lord Auchinduin was one of the Legion’s leaders.
        It’s a long and admirable story, but its essence is that unity is the
        key to victory. “Even now, 8000 years later, I feel the same proud way.”
        the prophet looked sadly towards the tavern floor and unexpectedly he
        continued his story. “Anyway, in that moment I thought not about the
        ancient ones, but about the camp. The place looked nice – on the east
        side we had a nice white forest, while on the opposite we had a deep
        valley. Southward was the place we came from – our ship and the Great
        Sea’s bay. Finally northward was yet unknown place that looked like a
        swamp. The camp itself was nothing but a place full of old centaur-fur
        tents. It was difficult to resist the chilling cold so many of us stayed
        in the camp as guards, others like short-range scouts and third just hid
        in their own tents and slept until the time for the Aran Food came. I
        thought that there will be plenty of time to sleep in the near future,
        when we finally establish a forest town or at least a small valley
        village, so I decided to go and study this strange land. There were
        pretty few warriors that chose the adventure than the warm, cozy tent. I
        saw those adventurers lead by the captain himself to depart in one group
        to the east. To the White Forest, as we called it later, for it was the
        first white one we saw. Elfish nature! They always choose the forests
        first, than any other place to explore. You should know, that even the
        sacred forests of the Hyjal foothills could be more dangerous even than
        the Swamps of Sorrow where I firstly opened the…” the prophet suddenly
        ceased speaking. His figure contoured in the dark tavern hall. As a few
        moments passed he proceeded talking about those very ancient times. “I
        asked Hyjal if he could come with me. I chose for my destination the
        ‘swamps’, because there probably would be nothing to explore in the
        valley. The next part is not so important about this tale. Hyjal and I
        went deep into the swamps, but saw no enemy. Everything was calm as if
        this was Hyjal summit itself. We had to be very cautious about our every
        little step or move for the swamp was not to be underestimated. The only
        thing we saw on that ‘journey’ was a deer that sunk into the swamp.
        Unfortunately we were not able to help it. Hyjal tried but it appeared
        that this place drains magical energies as good and fast as the Burning
        Legion’s lord does. When we saw this tragic case of death I suggested
        that we go back to the camp. Hyjal instantly agreed and thus we took the
        way back. It was about 15 minutes before the Aran Food to be served that
        we returned. The ritual was as normal as ever and after about 2 hours of
        conjuring and eating our druids told us about this land. Northrend was a
        small island covered with white stuff all over. They told us about the
        different trees and bushes and so on. After the maps had been written
        down our dryad scouts finally returned. Sad news was what they were
        bearing. Although I had no doubt that this land was inappropriate for
        the Night Elves to live, the dryads confirmed my thoughts, too. Sad, for
        it doomed us to look for another free land to inhabit. The next morning
        we calmly and melancholically walked towards the boats and rowed to the
        ship. That same afternoon we set sail to the east… Again.” the prophet
        stopped to take a breath. If someone have entered the tavern by that
        very moment he would see how a bunch of peasants have gathered around an
        old man, listening to him as careful as possible not to miss even a word
        from his speech. And so the prophet continued his story…<br />
        <br />
        Chapter 4 – The Vow<br />
        <br />
        “I cannot clearly tell what happened next on that journey.” The old man
        began. “What I can tell, however, is that we saw no land for many long
        days and nights. Just as we supposed there were only small islands,
        which were impossible to inhabit even by such a slight group of elves
        like us. Anyway, I used that time to let alone and think over all my
        thoughts. As I did so, Hyjal and the captain commanded the others. Hyjal
        was personally told by me to send sacred owls and Druids of the Talon to
        explore the sea before us. Those druids were the ones that were capable
        of transformation to crow form and were really fast scouts. I finally
        decided what should I be able to do for my people. One night as I was
        reading the ancient tomes of nature at the small library, I met
        Kul’Dare. He was one of those Druids of the Talon that were already sent
        to scout the sea ahead.<br />
        “Did you encounter anything?” I asked.<br />
        “No. Nothing in a very long distance, according to our maps.” he replied
        coldly.<br />
        “I have decided!” my voice trembled as I began “We will venture deeper
        in that continent here.” I pointed at the eastern side of the map in the
        book I was currently holding. “I know that it’s dangerous but … what
        could we do? There probably are no other free pieces of land in the
        whole world.” Kul’Dare was staring at my eyes as if he could look
        through them into my very mind.<br />
        “Did you tell this to Elune?” Elune was the captain of the ship. I was
        angered.<br />
        “Elune is no one! He commands only during our sea journey! I am the
        leader of this exile.” Kul’Dare did not move a bit and stood calmly as
        if nothing happened.<br />
        “Calm down ancient one!” he spoke to me “I meant no harm. Truly, Elune
        should only be told of this plan. As for me, I will follow you my old
        friend.”<br />
        “That’s really … kind of you. I swear now to lead our race of Night
        Elves in exile to a better life without even a small bit of magic! Go
        now, and announce my words to the rest of our brethren.” Kul’Dare left
        the room and I was let alone only with my thoughts in the library.
        Strange! I felt confident and untroubled by anything. I guessed what our
        destiny will be, but the vow that I made that day, I fulfilled.” with
        his last words, the prophet examined closely every one of his companions
        in the tavern. He looked deep into their hearts and seeing that they are
        just simple, ordinary people who mean no harm to anyone, he proceeded
        his story.<br />
        <br />
        Chapter 5 – The Green Skins<br />
        <br />
        “Yet, that day I didn’t know that the lands we were going to visit
        belong to the region of Quel’thalas” the prophet looked again at the
        people around him and after a few seconds he continued. “We, however,
        were not so close to Quel’thalas. Not yet. The next day after my
        conversation with Kul’Dare, I revealed my plan and vow to the rest of
        the crew. Elune seemed to be in agreement with the plan. As for Kul’Dare
        and Hyjal, well, I was never disappointed by them and just as I expected
        they stood behind me once again. Hyjal was a man of honor. All he wanted
        was a peaceful life. He was not of those people that ask plenty of
        questions or talk all the time. I liked him. Kul’Dare, on the other
        hand, was not so quiet person. Although he too was a man of action, he
        was a bit more talkative person. So, after everyone knew what we should
        do, I send the Druids of the Talon once again to scout ahead. For two
        long days there were no news from the scouts. I began to torture myself
        for I was who send them ahead. At the sunrise of the 3rd day Kul’Dare
        finally returned. I was stoned, for there was no one else with him. I
        send five scouts, for Elune!<br />
        “Where are the others” were the only words that slipped away from my
        mouth.<br />
        “Let’s go inside” said Kul’Dare and Hyjal, Elune and I went to the
        library.<br />
        “So” asked Elune. Kul’Dare began slowly his report.<br />
        “We flew about 14 hours to the east. Suddenly we saw a small island and
        decided to land and take a look. We couldn’t, though! As we approached
        the ground strange creatures began to shoot at us with gigantic arrows.
        That’s how the others died. Only Lasien survived but he too was wounded
        and after about 4 hours flying back he died. The only thing that saved
        me from their poisonous arrows was my speed. Unluckily the others were
        not as swift as I was” I couldn’t move my lips. I had so many, many
        questions that needed answers. Elune was the first to ask one of those
        questions.<br />
        “What were those creatures like” he asked shortly.<br />
        “Well, we saw them not but I gathered the impression that they were
        green skinned beings, as tall as we are, and very skilled fighters. The
        very strange thing was that they had no bows! They just threw away the
        ‘arrows’ with their own hands” Kul’Dare looked worried. Unnaturally
        Hyjal took his place in the conversation.<br />
        “May I suggest something master” he asked me.<br />
        “Sure, go ahead” I answered.<br />
        “If it is possible that we send a host of our people to the dwarven
        capital of Ironforge in the heart of the Red Ridge Mountains, to ask
        their elders what were those creatures. I suggest that we split in two
        groups. One of the groups will proceed to the lands of the northeast,
        while the other will go a bit southwards to visit the dwarves and gather
        some knowledge about the green-skins and the whole continent and its
        creatures as a whole. We will afterwards meet at our destination.
        Whatever our destination is” I hadn’t seen Hyjal in this form of
        speaking for years!<br />
        “This is a sound plan Hyjal” I was still amazed when I began my answer.<br
        />
        “I don’t know about anyone else but as for me Hyjal’s plan is perfect.
        As a matter of fact we will need a forest to inhabit, right? But even
        our ancients don’t know a thing about this continent we are about to
        reach and hopefully inhabit” I stopped.<br />
        “I have another suggestion” Elune suddenly said. “What if we really do
        so. I mean send scouts to the dwarven capital to learn about their
        culture and the lands, rivers, woods and lakes of the continent. Sounds
        like a plan! What I also suggest, though, is that the other group land
        on the island that lies just ahead, just to see if those green-skins are
        so invincible. Afterwards that group will catch up the others and we all
        will know where to live and what creatures inhabit this land” Elune
        stopped as suddenly as he started. “I am very proud of you guys when you
        talk like that” I revealed my feelings. “You told us a few nice plans
        and I guess this is what we will do. Elune, go and retell the crew your
        plan. Hyjal you are free, go and rest I’ll talk with you tomorrow and
        Kul’Dare – I want to ask you a bit more about the green-skins” I
        finished my speech excited. As I let out my last word everyone
        disappeared to handle his own task. I wondered for a moment whether we
        would finally find a place to live.<br />
        “You were saying” Kul’Dare asked me.<br />
        “Oh, yeah” I chased away my thoughts and turned towards Kul’Dare.
