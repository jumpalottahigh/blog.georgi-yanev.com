          Lord Lothar ruler of Azeroth and his trustworthy captain - sir Uther
          Lightbringer have left the castle in search for a nearby Orcish
          Encampment. Rumor has it that this base cannot be simply found. The
          first thing to evade is the many traps, left by Troll scouts, on the
          way towards the base. If you survive this part of the journey it is
          said that you will be ambushed by an undead demonic army. Only by
          slaying their leader, can the rift be open, and after you enter it, by
          crossing over the Twisting Nether you could go to the Red World of
          Draenor. There you must meet the Orcish leader, called by many Grom
          Hellscream.
          <br />
          <br />
          On the way to the Orcish base they met a noble leader of a Troll
          warband - Zuljin. He agreed to show the path to the rift to the 2
          brave knights, asking in return for the exact location of the tomb of
          Sargeras. Not having in mind the evil that is hidden in this place,
          Lord Lothar tells Zuljin to go to the castle at Stromgarde for further
          guidance.
          <br />
          <br />
          Rumors ain't just always true. We have passed about ten miles until
          now, and still there were no traps encountered. Rumors could not be
          just some bulshit spoken by each and every man, though. They could
          prove true... Lothar and Lightbringer were even more calm, no matter
          they were travelling through a dark forest. They got cheered up by the
          fact they ain't dead yet.
          <br />
          <br />
          Suddenly the sky rain fire. The undead demonic army, called the
          Scourge arrived... Having at hand so much experience won by thousands
          of battles and quests accomplished, the noble warriors realized their
          position with no delay. They quickly got off their horses and prepared
          for battle. The Undead army was approaching. Charging at the middle of
          the battlefield, the mighty knights perished most of their skeletal
          enemies, but when the battle hit the air... Demons were here in
          Azeroth once again, with their lord Sargeras. The knights could not
          hold the hellish breaths of the demons, thus they fell on the ground,
          being an easy target for Sargeras himself. It was easy for him to slay
          those tired, wounded men.
          <br />
          <br />
          Years after, Turalyon, son of the once mighty sir Uther Lightbringer,
          raised by the townsfolk of the home castle of his father's king - Lord
          Anduin Lothar, found his father's skeletal body while hunting wild
          boars. Turalyon was told of the Troll leader Zuljin, who once had deal
          with his father's master, so he decided to find this Troll and ask him
          about his father's death. People say that after receiving from the
          mages of Stromgarde the needed information about the tomb of Sargeras,
          he left travelling to the west, always to the west...
          <br />
          <br />
          Crossing over the Great Sea they got as far as no one else did. They
          made it to the shadowy lands of Kalimdor. Zuljin and his most trusted
          friends spent 27 years in search of this cursed tomb. They failed,
          though. Now we are ensured that no one knows the location of this
          tomb. At least that's what we thought...
          <br />
          <br />
          Night Elves arrived from the west last week, bringing chilling news
          about Zuljin and his warband. Unfortunately these aren't all the news
          they have for us. Lead by their Priestess of the Moon, the Elven
          Archers report that new rift has been opened in the far north
          continent of Northrend. Two new orcish warclans, lead by Cho'gal - a
          terrible Ogre-Magi, and Gul'dan - once a powerful shaman warlock, now
          being a death knight, practicing dark necromantic magiks, moved to the
          dark continent of Kalimdor, vanquishing all of the Night Elves' camps
          and forest towns. The only survivors of the Elves are travelling
          towards Azeroth, seeking us for help. We could help them, though, for
          they have provided us with important information. They say that Zuljin
          was living in peace with the Elves for about twenty years, after he
          quit the search for Sargeras' Tomb. He is dead by this moment... But
          the things are even worse...
          <br />
          <br />
          Que'Hena, the priestess of the moon, said that Gul'dan knows the
          location of the tomb of Sargeras. Elven scouts report that they have
          knowledge of the exact plans of the Orcish Hordes. They say that
          Cho'gal leads one of the warclans to Quel'thalas, then turns towards
          the road to Azeroth. Meanwhile Gul'dan himself conquers the dark
          continent and then leads a small band of his elite guards to the tomb
          of Sargeras, which is said to be located in a vault in the middle of
          the Great Sea. We must stop Gul'dan from releasing terror, hatred and
          destruction upon this world. He must not release Sargeras!!!
          <br />
          <br />
          Khadgar - supreme magi of Dalaran has demanded that all nations gather
          young, brave man that could follow him into glorious battle with the
          Orcish Hordes. From the half-elves' population comes Alleria - an
          elven ranger as noble as beautiful. A young boy from the peasants of
          Azeroth wants to become great hero, ready to sacrifice the little he
          has, so Turalyon himself plans to teach him in the basics of being an
          honorable knight for the human race. This young boy was named Danath.
          <br />
          <br />
          Meanwhile Gul'dan was slaughtering all the remaining Night Elves on
          the continent of Kalimdor. He was preparing for his journey to the
          tomb of Sargeras. Cho'gal, however, was establishing a massive ground
          control over the ruined, once Dwarven lands of Quel'thalas. Dentarg -
          a young Ogre - is being trained by Cho'gal for becoming a powerful
          bloodthirsty Ogre-Magi, and thus getting the command over the Laughing
          Skull clan when Cho'gal decides. There are things you can never plan,
          though. Some creatures aren't thankful to you for giving them
          oppurtunities that many else don't have. That's just the case of
          Dentarg. After being thaught the ancient magiks of the Ogre-Magi,
          Dentarg saw the oppurtunity of removing the current leader of the
          Laughing Skull - Cho'gal, and thus becoming a powerful leader with the
          great desire of eliminating all humans. He slew Cho'gal easy enough by
          stabing him with an obsidian orcish knife in the back of his head. The
          Orish Hordes are just a bunch of critters without a leader, they
          didn't even understand the reason for their previous warchief's death.
          Many years ago it was Blackhand's bloody example of how you can take
          the command over all orcs in your hands, but it seemed that these
          hopeless creatures have forgotten even this. All they understood was
          that they had new leader in the face of Dentarg. So he united the
          different creatures under his private command easily.
