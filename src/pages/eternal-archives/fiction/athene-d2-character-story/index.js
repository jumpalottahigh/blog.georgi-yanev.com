        Her parents were the magicion Zeus from Diablo I and the sorceress
        Athine-Palade from Diablo II LOD. These two magi-being people had their
        own two daughters named Athine-Palade and Athine-Palade II. After some
        years passed Athine-Palade II left their homeland and went to the east,
        experiencing her life in LOD mysteries. Athine-Palade (the other
        daughter) lived with her family for many many years, while one day
        suddenly from the sky fell fire! All people were anihilaited and burnt
        down to the ground, leaving only ashes as the last proof of their once
        glorious existance. Only Athine (the daughter) remained just like she
        was. She hadn't even one scratch. The god of hellfire left her only
        because he knew that he will not be able to kill her, even with all the
        dark powers surrounding him. He had the knowledge of Tyriel. The angel
        of light always had the protection of someone. First it was Zeus that
        the angel was protecting. Then Tyriel was protecting the LOD sorci
        Athine-Palade (the mother). Tyriel didn't want this to happen but orders
        came from above so that he had to push on and leave these two family
        mages, with whom he had shared many many years. He was told to go find
        the new born sister of this magi family, named -- Athine-Palade II. She
        was LOD experienced character so it was easy for Tyriel to find her.
        Three months later he found her at the battle-net area fighting some
        really good other heroes for the holy armor, known by mortal men as
        Arcane's Valor v1.08. She had heard of her father that he once had that
        armor, but during one glorious battle he was pushed to flee, so he left
        this powerful item. After watching how the young 76 lvl sorci slew these
        two paladins and one amazon, Tyriel left his hiding place and revealed
        himself to Athine-Palade II. He gave her the name of Matriarch of the
        whole mortal realm and drove her to the most distant heaven inpost.
        These were places of high rating, which only the most experienced and
        noble characters can go to. After leaving Athine-Palade II there, Tyriel
        was given orders to go back to her parents and protect the new born
        daughter Athine-Palade. Yes, these two old friends had their new
        daughter named after her mother. Tyriel was told to hurry, though. Dark
        powers were sensed to temporary surround the homeland of the
        magi-family. It was Tyriel who had to hurry up, becuse of the orders
        above, so he decided to sacrifice his own life and title for this holy
        operation. If he had gone the normal way back through all the towns and
        areas, he would had missed the attack over the mortal realm. He went
        through the undead realm, which he was told not to go through. Not even
        one angel should ever visit this place, which is known by mortal men as
        Chaos Sanctuary. Diablo used this place many years ago to rise his
        undead minions and send them to terrorise Heaven's last outpost before
        the shadows of Hell. This was the same outpost, named Pandemonium
        Fortress, that all the heroes who were brave enough to face Diablo had
        came to. Not even one of them, though, came back or slew Diablo. Even
        for Athine-Palade II, and for Her mother was difficult to do so, so they
        cleaverly and wisely skipped this part of their march against evil! So
        Tyriel had to go through this place, only by himself. The last step he
        had always moved in here was just before the door out from the
        Pandemonium Fortress. He had his fears, but none of them happened. It
        appeared that there was nobody inside the Chaos Sanctuary. That was no
        good, though he was happy that no one can stop him here. The secret
        thought of Tyriel already knew what was going to happed. Diablo and his
        minions were just about to attack the magi family. That's why orders
        from above told Tyriel to hurry up to protect once again the magi family
        against the dark powers of the undead realm. Terror, Destruction and
        Hatred should not come loose upon this mortal world. The other part of
        the adventure back was nothing but a secure and long journey in time.
        During all this time Athine-Palade, the "new born" sister, was already
        17 years old, so she was just ready for the magicks and ancients secrets
        exam of the older sorceresses, mages, magis and all who pretend to use
        magic as their weapon for defending the Light and the mortal realm.
        Humans have always thought they were the best, they can do anything.
        Tyriel knew they can't! He was just approaching their possition, while
        the sky rained fire, all the rivers covered with human blood, the water
        was Hatred... The sky was Destruction... The wind drifting shadows of
        dead long ago noble heroes was TERROR... Mephisto, Diablo and Baal came
        among us once again. Tyriel could not believe his eyes. How could this
        happen. There were so many fearless heroes that fought against the power
        of darkness. Damn, I told the command above that Diablo won't waste
        time. He was preparing this powerful blow over the mortals all these
        years. Now I remember, why I was told not to mess with Diablo while he
        first attack the peaceful village of Tristram. Yep, Diablo was not in
        there at that moment. He created dangerous and huge monster of the souls
        he had killed. This monster was slain. With it the first step of
        conquering the humanity was made. The hero that slew it was called
        Kilain - a rogue from the near Rogue Encampment. She then gave birth to
        a kid, which she named Kilain, after her. Three day after, the skys
        darkened announcing that the soul of Kilain was now one of Diablo's most
        dangerous weapons. The small town of Tristram was almost burnt to ashes,
        Griswold and Wirt were killed, only one old man, named Decard Cain,
        survived. I drove him to Heaven's inpost for great heroes. He is sound
        and healthy even now... Many heroes tried to kill Diablo (the old brave
        Kilain). She mutated, though and everybody forgot about what she had
        done for Tristram. Her daughter Kilain found "Diablo-Kilain" and killed
        him. Once again the humans celebrated, while I knew that was not
        Diablo's soul again. Untill now many heroes tried to find the other two
        brothers, but nobody did so. Now I guess the THREE brothers found what
        they were searching for. When all people were killed without Tyriel to
        be able to do something, Athine-Palade was still alive. She couldn't
        believe her eyes. All her friends were dead. The sense of revenge began
        to torture deep inside her. Tyriel showed up. He told Athine-Palade
        about what was happening all these years, what he had remembered of.
        Should you Athine follow the Light and go after Diablo, Mephisto and
        Baal once again, sacrificing your life, or may be should you stand
        against the Light above and ask them why did they let Diablo do his show
        all these years. Why so many noble heroes and brave townsman had to die
        before Diablo. Was this script for the humanity, which it could not
        change. The people wanted peace everywhere. They were tired of all the
        bloody wars of terror, the hatred between people and the destruction of
        the terror and hatred. It is up to you now what to do. Choose your
        destiny!
