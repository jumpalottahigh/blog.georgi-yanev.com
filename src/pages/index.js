    <h1>Hi!</h1>
    <p>I'm Georgi and I like to write code, tinker with Home Automation projects and I am now learning how to fly FPV racing drones.</p>
    <p>Currently I work as a web developer, but I have done somewhat different things in my time around including: writing fan fiction, making hip hop, being a bartender and more.</p>
    <p>I see myself as a fairly technical person heavily invested in all things web with a great interest in AR, VR and AI. Also, &lt;3 OSS.</p>
    <img src={introImage} alt="YAR cover image" />
    <p>I am planning to document here some of my OSS projects, Home Automation progress and FPV drone freestyle flights and setup.</p>
    <p>In the meantime, if you are brave enough and want to take a peak of the unedited view of the world through the eyes of a ~15-17 year old in the early 2000s - venture into the Eternal Archives part of the blog.</p>
