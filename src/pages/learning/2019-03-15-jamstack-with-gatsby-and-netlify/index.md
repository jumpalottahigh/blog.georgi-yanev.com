The below is based on the talk I gave at Frontend Finland called: "JAMstack with Gatsby and Netlify".

## Intro and why

I'd like to share some thoughts about the [JAMstack][1]. And in particular the JAMstack with [Gatsby][2] and [Netlify][3]. And here's what my angle is coming at this. I work as a web developer at F-Secure and I am convinced that performance on the web matters. The web just had its 30th birthday and it's our job to build performing and high quality experiences, but more on this later. For now let's dive into the JAMstack.

## So what is the JAMstack?

If you head on over to [jamstack.org][4] you will probably notice this graphic.
