I've always wanted to write a book! This posts uncovers the events that ultimately brought me here and now. I hope it also servers as a story you could draw inspiration from. I hope it would motivate you to jump into whatever it may be that you would like to accomplish and just start going at it slowly and steadily, step by step. You can do it!

## üìö Story and why

**I've always wanted to write a book**. In fact, when I was a kid (~8-10), I wrote a couple of small encyclopedias and a bunch of fictional short stories. I guess I outgrew this phase and for a while did other things, but thanks primarily to my English language teacher in high school - Milena Grudeva and in some portion thanks to [Blizzard for creating the Warcraft universe][4], this writing passion resurfaced again during my teenage years (~15-17).

This time I attempted to **write fan fiction in English for the first time**. Disclaimer, my mother tongue is Bulgarian, so for me this was different. On some level harder, and on another level more intuitive. I think it went well, I had fun, I learned a lot, and I wrote those few short stories listed under the `fiction` section on this [eternal archives page][3]. Nothing really special about them, most were finished, albeit very short, others were never completed.

Then I just always figured that someday I'd write a book. I didn't know when, what and how, but I thought it would be most probably some fiction I would write during my 40s.

Funnily, when we [moved to Finland with my girlfriend in 2012][5], and I was soon about to go through a big career change, going from restaurant business to software development, right before I applied to the university, I **reached out for writing** again. This time it was an idea for a medieval fantasy setting and I only got as far as to write the first few scenes with main characters in a banquet hall and events unfolding during a royal feast.

I have been focusing on getting into software development since. The more time I spent around other developers (in person and online) the more I got convinced how critical was clear and effective communication. Many times in writing. And the more I communicated and wrote, the more I practiced and in the end, I have to admit - I like it.

> **Finally, writing articles for this blog has been instrumental to my final decision to take up the adventure of writing a book!**

I've received a LOT of great feedback for my technical FPV drone setup instructional articles, and knowing that ~ 1000 people per month read those articles, makes me feel like they matter, which gives me the strength to try to make them as best as I could and truly inspires me to keep writing.

The last bit of this story that ultimately pushed me to commit to writing a book unfolded on Twitter during November 2018. Through developers I follow, namely [Kent C. Dodds][6] and [Jani Evakallio][7], I learned that a thing called [NaNoWriMo][8] exists. NaNoWriMo expands to **National Novel Writing Month**, apparently it had been happening for quite a few years so far, and in a nutshell, it boils down to you committing to writing a book (or at least 50 000 words) during the month of November. The event runs annually. **I felt hooked, it immediately appealed to me to be something I could really want to try and be able to complete if I prepare and dedicate myself to it. I was VERY excited.**

However, when I found out about it, **NaNoWriMo 2018** had already been going on for ~ 10 days so I was a bit late to the party and admittedly I had one too many things on my plate already. Not to mention that I definitely needed to get prepared to pull this off.

This leads me to plan my participation in **NaNoWriMo 2019**. I would get ready and I would pull it off. That was and is my plan. Here is where I give inspirational credit for the second time to Kent C. Dodds as resources I found out about from him have helped me the most and have inspired me the most so far. Things like the [StoryGrid videos][9], the [Writing Excuses][10] podcast have really started shaping how I see and understand writing in as little as 2-3 months.

> **Making me believe that I can, indeed, do this!**

Which leads us to the preparation phase. This post aims to follow my progress and keep me accountable (I also publish short tweet monthly updates).

## üë®‚Äçüè≠ Preparation

In the beginning, I didn't have any strict preparation guidelines. I just tried to immerse myself into the writing field. Just trying to get an overall sense for what there is. A couple of things that have helped tremendously to get me excited and into thinking about writing and how to approach writing are the [StoryGrid][9] and the [Writing Excuses][10] podcast. They deserve the double mention too! This is also backed partially by my daily commute to work - **I spend about 50 hours monthly in my car**. Which is actually a good thing in this case, as it provides a decent chunk of time for listening to audiobooks and podcasts. I had also started reading fairy tales with my son a few months ago and that's a lot of fun and reminds me of when my dad was reading to me books about [Robinson Crusoe][11], [Captain Nemo][12] and the [Iliad][13] when I was little. I really enjoyed those moments.

#### So this is my rough initial plan:

- **[Read and listen to more books][15]**

- **Listen to podcasts, YouTube videos by writers**

- **Craft and analyze stories**

- **Read [The Elements of Style][14]**

- **Practice brainstorming**

- **Outline a novel idea by scenes**

- **Don't edit self while writing and don't write while editing**

The goal is by the time I have to announce the novel I'll be working on (September 2019), to have the somewhat solid groundwork to work on during November. Then, **when the time comes and the gong rings, to start off writing in November 2019 during NaNoWriMo and write a decent story of at least 50 000 words**. Sounds good, let's do it!

> **Ultimately, I just want to craft and tell a good story**
