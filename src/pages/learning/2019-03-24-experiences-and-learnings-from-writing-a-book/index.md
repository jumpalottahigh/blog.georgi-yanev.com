## Story and why

- Always wanted
- Wrote stuff when child
- Always thought would write a book but much later in life (didnt deem self capable)

- Found out about NaNoWriMo thru KCD and Jani
- The idea resonated with me and made me feel like I can do it

- Been blogging for over 1.5 years and I like writing, and people are reading the articles and say they were helpful

- Resources from KCD have been crazy helpful and motivated me tenfold - Writing Excuses podcast in particular

- Started reading fairly tales with my son during last summer + I have awesome memories with my dad reading to me Robinson Crusoe, Captain Nemo and the Illiad when I was very little

- I love analyzing stories; what's working in movies or not for example

- The need to communicate clear and conscise (been practicing for a while and trying to get better)

## Preparation

- Overall

- Thinking about plots

- The elements of style

- Reading books

- Listening to books

- Podcasts and immersing self in the field

- Brainstorming
