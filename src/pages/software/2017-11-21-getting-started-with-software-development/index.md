How to become a semi-decent developer in about 5 years

[[INTRO]]
First of all, let's start with this - you probably won't become a very good software developer in 5 years and that's OK! If you are very lucky and depending on your background you might become a semi-decent one. Of course that's a bold statement, highly opinionated and insanely subjective but bare with me here. This article does not aim to tell you what you can and cannot achieve, rather inspire and highlight a few topics that maybe don't get mentioned as often when people are talking about taking up a career in software engineering. I believe these topics just as important if not even more so that the programming language course you are taking right now.
There are many articles on the topic of what path to take, what books to read and courses to participate in. This article takes a fundamentally different approach to the subject. Past the disclaimer you will only find topics I wish someone had pointed out to me when I was starting out.

[[DISCLAIMER]]
What this is NOT:

- extensive resources post that lists all the best resources to study or courses available
- my journey has just begun; I am only now starting to grasp certain things and connect the dots; I by far do not know it all

[[MAIN]]

These topics are in no particular order, because at the end of the day you might want to do some of these things and others not. Chances are the different topics have a different weight for each and every one of us as well. Rather, look at the list and prioritize the items to your liking. I like to think of this list as ingredients for a soup where the end result always ends well depending on your taste and the amount required is determined by you.

### Create accounts

**Github**. You definitely want a Github account. That's where open source and a lot of cool projects happen. You also probably want to have your repositories mostly public as that is a good starting point to collaborate with others, to receive feedback, issues and pull requests. This is easily one of the most important accounts to have...

**LinkedIn**. Definitely a must have. Whether you like LinkedIn or notI for one never managed to get an interesting feed out of it, but you might be luckier.

[[CONCLUSION]]
Never forget that "every good programmer is only there because they did work they were not qualified for and learnt along the way".
